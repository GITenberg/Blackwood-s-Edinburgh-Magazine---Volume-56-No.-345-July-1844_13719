      <h2>CAUSES OF THE INCREASE OF CRIME.</h2>

      <p>If the past increase and present amount of crime in the
      British islands be alone considered, it must afford grounds for
      the most melancholy forebodings. When we recollect that since the
      year 1805, that is, during a period of less than forty years, in
      the course of which population has advanced about sixty-five
      <i>per cent</i> in Great Britain and Ireland, crime in England
      has increased seven hundred per cent, in Ireland about eight
      hundred per cent, and in Scotland above <i>three thousand six
      hundred per cent</i>;<sup>1</sup> it is difficult to say what is
      destined to be the ultimate fate of a country in which the
      progress of wickedness is so much more rapid than the increase of
      the numbers of the people. Nor is the alarming nature of the
      prospect diminished by the reflection, that this astonishing
      increase in human depravity has taken place during a period of
      unexampled prosperity and unprecedented progress, during which
      the produce of the national industry had tripled, and the labours
      of the husbandman kept pace with the vast increase in the
      population they were to feed&mdash;in which the British empire
      carried its victorious arms into every quarter of the globe, and
      colonies sprang up on all sides with unheard-of rapidity&mdash;in
      which a hundred thousand emigrants came ultimately to migrate
      every year from the parent state into the new regions conquered
      by its arms, or discovered by its adventure. If this is the
      progress of crime during the days of its prosperity, what is it
      likely to become in those of its decline, when this prodigious
      vent for superfluous numbers has come to be in a great measure
      closed, and this unheard-of wealth and prosperity has ceased to
      gladden the land?</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>1: See No. 343, <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, p. 534, Vol.
        lv.</p>
      </div>

      <p>To discover to what causes this extraordinary increase of
      crime is to be ascribed, we must first examine the localities in
      which it has principally arisen, and endeavour to ascertain
      whether it is to be found chiefly in the agricultural, pastoral,
      or manufacturing districts. We must then consider the condition
      of the labouring classes, and the means provided to restrain them
      in the quarters where the progress of crime has been most
      alarming; and inquire whether the existing evils are
      insurmountable and unavoidable, or have arisen from the
      supineness, the errors, and the selfishness of man. The inquiry
      is one of the most interesting which can occupy the thoughts of
      the far-seeing and humane; for it involves the temporal and
      eternal welfare of millions of their fellow-creatures;&mdash;it
      may well arrest the attention of the selfish, and divert for a
      few minutes the profligate from their pursuits; for on it depends
      whether the darling wealth of the former is to be preserved or
      destroyed, and the exciting enjoyments of the other arrested or
      suffered to continue.</p>

      <p>To elucidate the first of these questions, we subjoin a table,
      compiled <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg002" id=
      "pg002">002</a></span>from the Parliamentary returns, exhibiting
      the progress of serious crime in the principal counties,
      agricultural pastoral, and manufacturing, of the empire, during
      the last fifteen years. We are unwilling to load our pages with
      figures, and are well aware how distasteful they are to a large
      class of readers; and if those results were as familiar to others
      as they are to ourselves, we should be too happy to take them for
      granted, as they do first principles in the House of Commons, and
      proceed at once to the means of remedy. But the facts on this
      subject have been so often misrepresented by party or prejudice,
      and are in themselves so generally unknown, that it is
      indispensable to lay a foundation in authentic information before
      proceeding further in the inquiry. The greatest difficulty which
      those practically acquainted with the subject experience in such
      an investigation, is to make people believe their statements,
      even when founded on the most extensive practical knowledge, or
      the more accurate statistical inquiry. There is such a prodigious
      difference between the condition of mankind and the progress of
      corruption in the agricultural or pastoral, and manufacturing or
      densely peopled districts, that those accustomed to the former
      will not believe any statements made regarding the latter. They
      say they are incredible or exaggerated; that the persons who make
      them are <i>têtes montées</i>; that their ideas are very vague,
      and their suggestions utterly unworthy the consideration either
      of men of sense or of government. With such deplorable illusions
      does ignorance repel the suggestions of knowledge; theory, of
      experience; selfishness, of philanthropy; cowardice, of
      resolution. Thus nothing whatever is done to remedy or avert the
      existing evils: the districts not endangered unite as one man to
      resist any attempt to form a general system for the alleviation
      of misery or diminution of crime in those that are, and the
      preponderance of the unendangered districts in the legislature
      gives them the means of effectually doing so. The evils in the
      endangered districts are such, that it is universally felt they
      are beyond the reach of local remedy or alleviation. Thus,
      between the two, nothing whatever is done to arrest, or guard
      against, the existing or impending evils. Meanwhile, destitution,
      profligacy, sensuality, and crime, advance with unheard-of
      rapidity in the manufacturing districts, and the dangerous
      classes there massed together combine every three or four years
      in some general strike or alarming insurrection, which, while it
      lasts, excites universal terror, and is succeeded, when
      suppressed, by the same deplorable system of supineness,
      selfishness, and infatuation.</p>

        <i>Census</i> 1841.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The table in the note exhibits the number of commitments for
      serious offences, with the population of each, of eight
      counties&mdash;pastoral, agricultural, and manufacturing&mdash;in
      Great Britain during the year 1841<sup>2</sup>. We take the
      returns for that year, both because it was the year in which the
      census was taken, and because the succeeding year, 1842, being
      the year of the great outbreak in England, and violent strike in
      Scotland, the figures, both in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg003" id="pg003">003</a></span>that and the succeeding year,
      may be supposed to exhibit a more unfavourable result for the
      manufacturing districts than a fair average of years. From this
      table, it appears that the vast preponderance of crime is to be
      found in the manufacturing or densely-peopled districts, and that
      the proportion per cent of commitments which they exhibit, as
      compared with the population, is generally three, often five
      times, what appears in the purely agricultural and pastoral
      districts. The comparative criminality of the agricultural,
      manufacturing, and pastoral districts is not to be considered as
      accurately measured by these returns, because so many of the
      agricultural counties, especially in England, are overspread with
      towns and manufactories or collieries. Thus Kent and Shropshire
      are justly classed with agricultural counties, though part of the
      former is in fact a suburb of London, and of the latter
      overspread with demoralizing coal mines. The entire want of any
      police force in some of the greatest manufacturing counties, as
      Lanarkshire, by permitting nineteen-twentieths of the crime to go
      unpunished, exhibits a far less amount of criminality than would
      be brought to light under a more vigilant system. But still there
      is enough in this table to attract serious and instructive
      attention. It appears that the average of seven pastoral counties
      exhibits an average of 1 commitment for serious offences out of
      1155 souls: of eight counties, partly agricultural and partly
      manufacturing, of 1 in 682: and of eight manufacturing and
      mining, of 1 in 476! And the difference between individual
      counties is still more remarkable, especially when counties
      purely agricultural or pastoral can be compared with those for
      the most part manufacturing or mining. Thus the proportion of
      commitment for serious crime in the pastoral counties of</p>

      </div>

      <p>Further, the statistical returns of crime demonstrate, not
      only that such is the present state of crime in the densely
      peopled and manufacturing districts, compared to what obtains in
      the agricultural or pastoral, but that the tendency of matters is
      still worse;<sup>4</sup> and that, great as has been <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg005" id="pg005">005</a></span>the increase
      of population during the last thirty years in the manufacturing
      and densely peopled districts, the progress of crime has been
      still greater and more alarming. From the instructive and curious
      tables below, constructed from the criminal returns given in
      <i>Porter's Parliamentary Tables</i>, and the returns of the
      census taken in 1821, 1831, and 1841, it appears, that while in
      some of the purely pastoral counties, such as Selkirk and
      Anglesey, crime has remained during the last twenty years nearly
      stationary, and in some of the purely agricultural, such as Perth
      and Aberdeen, it has considerably <i>diminished</i>, in the
      agricultural and mining or manufacturing, such as Shropshire and
      Kent, it has <i>doubled</i> during the same period: and in the
      manufacturing and mining districts, such as Lancashire,
      Staffordshire, Yorkshire, and Renfrewshire, more than
      <i>tripled</i> in the same time. It appears, from the same
      authentic sources of information, that the progress of crime
      during the last twenty years has been much more rapid in the
      manufacturing and densely peopled than in the simply densely
      peopled districts; for in Middlesex, during the last twenty
      years, population has advanced about fifty per cent, and serious
      crime has increased in nearly the same proportion, having swelled
      from 2480 to 3514: whereas in Lancashire, during the same period,
      population has advanced also fifty per cent, but serious crime
      has considerably <i>more than doubled</i>, having risen from 1716
      to 3987.</p>

        <p>&mdash;PORTER'S <i>Parl. Tables, and Census</i> 1841.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Here, then, we are at length on firm ground in point of fact.
      Several writers of the liberal school who had a partiality for
      manufactures, because their chief political supporters were to be
      found among that class of society, have laboured hard to show
      that manufactures are noways detrimental either to health or
      morals; and that the mortality and crime of the manufacturing
      counties were in no respect greater than those of the pastoral or
      agricultural districts. The common sense of mankind has uniformly
      revolted against this absurdity, so completely contrary to what
      experience every where tells in a language not to be
      misunderstood; but it has now been completely disproved by the
      Parliamentary returns. The criminal statistics have exposed this
      fallacy as completely, in reference to the different degrees of
      depravity in different parts of the empire, as the
      registrar-general's returns have, in regard to the different
      degrees of salubrity in employments, and mortality in rural
      districts and manufacturing places. It now distinctly appears
      that crime is greatly more prevalent in proportion to the numbers
      of the people in densely peopled than thinly inhabited
      localities, and that it is making far more rapid progress in the
      former situation than the latter. Statistics are not to be
      despised when they thus, at once and decisively, disprove errors
      so assiduously spread, maintained by writers of such
      respectability, and supported by such large and powerful bodies
      in the state.</p>

      <p>Nor can it be urged with the slightest degree of foundation,
      that this superior criminality of the manufacturing and densely
      peopled districts is owing to a police force being more generally
      established than in the agricultural or pastoral, and thus crime
      being more thoroughly detected in the former situation than the
      latter. For, in the first place, in several of the greatest
      manufacturing counties, particularly Lanarkshire in Scotland,
      there is no police at all; and the criminal establishment is just
      what it was forty years ago. In the next place, a police force is
      the <i>consequence</i> of a previous vast accumulation or crime,
      and is never established till the risk to life and insecurity to
      property had rendered it unbearable. Being always established by
      the voluntary assessment of the inhabitants, nothing can be more
      certain than that it never can be called into existence but by
      such an increase of crime as has rendered it a matter of
      necessity.</p>

      <p>We are far, however, from having approached the whole truth,
      if we have merely ascertained, upon authentic evidence, that
      crime is greatly more prevalent in the manufacturing than the
      rural districts. That will probably be generally conceded; and
      the preceding details have been given merely to show the extent
      of the difference, and the rapid steps which it is taking. It is
      more material to inquire what are the causes of this superior
      profligacy <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg006" id=
      "pg006">006</a></span>of manufacturing to rural districts; and
      whether it arises unavoidably from the nature of their respective
      employments, or is in some degree within the reach of human
      amendment or prevention.</p>

      <p>It is usual for persons who are not practically acquainted
      with the subject, to represent manufacturing occupations as
      necessarily and inevitably hurtful to the human mind. The
      crowding together, it is said, young persons, of different sexes
      and in great numbers, in the hot atmosphere and damp occupations
      of factories or mines, is necessarily destructive to morality,
      and ruinous to regularity of habit. The passions are excited by
      proximity of situation or indecent exposure; infant labour early
      emancipates the young from parental control; domestic
      subordination, the true foundation for social virtue, is
      destroyed; the young exposed to temptation before they have
      acquired strength to resist it; and vice spreads the more
      extensively from the very magnitude of the establishments on
      which the manufacturing greatness of the country depends. Such
      views are generally entertained by writers on the social state of
      the country; and being implicitly adopted by the bulk of the
      community, the nation has abandoned itself to a sort of despair
      on the subject, and regarding manufacturing districts as the
      necessary and unavoidable hotbed of crimes, strives only to
      prevent the spreading of the contagion into the rural parts of
      the country.</p>

      <p>There is certain degree of truth in these observations; but
      they are much exaggerated, and it is not in these causes that the
      principal sources of the profligacy of the manufacturing
      districts is to be found.</p>

      <p>The real cause of the demoralization of manufacturing towns is
      to be found, not in the nature of the employment which the people
      there receive, so much as in the manner in which they are brought
      together, the unhappy prevalence of general strikes, and the
      prodigious multitudes who are cast down by the ordinary
      vicissitudes of life, or the profligacy of their parents, into a
      situation of want, wretchedness, and despair.</p>

      <p>Consider how, during the last half century, the people have
      been brought together in the great manufacturing districts of
      England and Scotland. So rapid has been the progress of
      manufacturing industry during that period, that it has altogether
      out-stripped the powers of population in the districts where it
      was going forward, and occasioned a prodigious influx of persons
      from different and distant quarters, who have migrated from their
      paternal homes, and settled in the manufacturing districts, never
      to return.<sup>5</sup> Authentic <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg007" id="pg007">007</a></span>evidence proves, that not less
      than <i>two millions</i> of persons have, in this way, been
      transferred to the manufacturing counties of the north of England
      within the last forty years, chiefly from the agricultural
      counties of the south of that kingdom, or from Ireland. Not less
      than three hundred and fifty thousand persons have, during the
      same period, migrated into the two manufacturing counties of
      Lanark and Renfrew alone, in Scotland, chiefly from the Scotch
      Highlands, or north of Ireland. No such astonishing migration of
      the human species in so short a time, and to settle on so small a
      space, is on record in the whole annals of the world. It is
      unnecessary to say that the increase is to be ascribed chiefly,
      if not entirely, to immigration; for it is well known that such
      is the unhealthiness of manufacturing towns, especially to young
      children, that, so far from being able to add to their numbers,
      they are hardly ever able, without extraneous addition, to
      maintain them.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Various causes have combined to produce demoralization among
      the vast crowd, thus suddenly attracted, by the alluring prospect
      of high wages and steady employment, from the rural to the
      manufacturing districts. In the first place, they acquired wealth
      before they had learned how to use it, and that is, perhaps, the
      most general cause of the rapid degeneracy of mankind. High wages
      flowed in upon them before they had acquired the artificial wants
      in the gratification of which they could be innocently spent.
      Thence the general recourse to the grosser and sensual
      enjoyments, which are powerful alike on the savage and the sage.
      Men who, in the wilds of Ireland or the mountains of Scotland,
      were making three or four shillings a-week, or in Sussex ten,
      suddenly found themselves, as cotton-spinners, iron-moulders,
      colliers, or mechanics, in possession of from twenty to thirty
      shillings. Meanwhile, their habits and inclinations had undergone
      scarce any alteration; they had no taste for comfort in dress,
      lodging, or furniture; and as to laying by money, the thing, of
      course, was not for a moment thought of. Thus, this vast addition
      to their incomes was spent almost exclusively on eating and
      drinking. The extent to which gross sensual enjoyment was thus
      spread among these first settlers in the regions of commercial
      opulence, is incredible. It is an ascertained fact, that above a
      million a-year is annually spent in Glasgow on ardent
      spirits;<sup>6</sup> and it has recently been asserted by a
      respectable and intelligent operative in Manchester, that, in
      that city, 750,000 <i>more</i> is annually spent on beer and
      spirits, than on the purchase of provisions. Is it surprising
      that a large part of the progeny of a generation which has
      embraced such habits, should be sunk in sensuality and
      profligacy, and afford a never-failing supply for the prisons and
      transport ships? It is the counterpart of the sudden corruption
      which invariably overtakes northern conquerors, when they settle
      in the regions of southern opulence.</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>6: ALISON <i>on Population</i>, ii. Appendix A.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Another powerful cause which promotes the corruption of men,
      when thus suddenly congregated together from different quarters
      in the manufacturing districts, is, that the restraints of
      character, relationship, and vicinity are, in a great measure,
      lost in the crowd. Every body knows what powerful influence
      public opinion, or the opinion of their relations, friends, and
      acquaintances, exercises on all men in their native seats, or
      when living for any length of time in one situation. It forms, in
      fact, next to religion, the most powerful restraint on vice, and
      excitement to virtue, that exists in the world. But when several
      hundred thousand of the working classes are suddenly huddled
      together in densely peopled localities, this invaluable check is
      wholly lost. Nay, what is worse, it is rolled over to the other
      side; and forms an additional incentive to licentiousness. The
      poor in these situations have no neighbours who care for them, or
      even know their names; but they are surrounded by multitudes who
      are willing to accompany them in the career of sensuality. They
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg008" id=
      "pg008">008</a></span>are unknown alike to each other, and to any
      persons of respectability or property in their vicinity.
      Philanthropy seeks in vain for virtue amidst thousands and tens
      of thousands of unknown names; charity itself is repelled by the
      hopelessness of all attempts to relieve the stupendous mass of
      destitution which follows in the train of such enormous
      accumulation of numbers. Every individual or voluntary effort is
      overlooked amidst the prodigious multitude, as it was in the
      Moscow campaign of Napoleon. Thus the most powerful restraints on
      human conduct&mdash;character, relations, neighbourhood&mdash;are
      lost upon mankind at the very time when their salutary influence
      is most required to enable them to withstand the increasing
      temptations arising from density of numbers and a vast increase
      of wages. Multitudes remove responsibility without weakening
      passion. Isolation ensures concealment without adding to
      resolution. This is the true cause of the more rapid
      deterioration of the character of the poor than the rich, when
      placed in such dense localities. The latter have a neighbourhood
      to watch them, because their station renders them
      conspicuous&mdash;the former have none. Witness the rapid and
      general corruption of the higher ranks, when they get away from
      such restraint, amidst the profligacy of New South Wales.</p>

      <p>In the foremost rank of the causes which demoralize the urban
      and mining population, we must place the frequency of those
      strikes which unhappily have now become so common as to be of
      more frequent occurrence than a wet season, even in our humid
      climate. During the last twenty years there have been six great
      strikes: viz. in 1826, 1828, 1834, 1837, 1842, and 1844. All of
      these have kept multitudes of the labouring poor idle for months
      together. Incalculable is the demoralization thus produced upon
      the great mass of the working classes. We speak not of the actual
      increase of commitments during the continuance of a great strike,
      though that increase is so considerable that it in general
      augments them in a single year from thirty to fifty per
      cent.<sup>7</sup> We allude to the far more general and lasting
      causes of demoralization which arise from the arraying of one
      portion of the community in fierce hostility against another, the
      wretchedness which is spread among multitudes by months of
      compulsory idleness, and the not less ruinous effect of depriving
      them of <i>occupation</i> during such protracted periods. When we
      recollect that such is the vehemence of party feeling produced by
      these disastrous combinations, that it so far obliterates all
      sense of right and wrong as generally to make their members
      countenance contumely and insult, sometimes even robbery,
      fire-raising, and murder, committed on innocent persons who are
      only striving to earn an honest livelihood for themselves by hard
      labour, but in opposition to the strike; and that it induces
      twenty and thirty thousand persons to yield implicit obedience to
      the commands of an unknown committee, who have power to force
      them to do what the Sultan Mahmoud, or the Committee of Public
      Safety, never ventured to attempt&mdash;to abstain from labour,
      and endure want and starvation for months together, for an object
      of which they often in secret disapprove&mdash;it may be
      conceived how wide-spread and fatal is the confusion of moral
      principle, and habits of idleness and insubordination thus
      produced. Their effects invariably appear for a course of years
      afterwards, in the increased roll of criminal commitments, and
      the number of young persons of both sexes, who, loosened by these
      protracted periods <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg009" id=
      "pg009">009</a></span>of idleness, never afterwards regain habits
      of regularity and industry. Nor is the evil lessened by the blind
      infatuation with which it is uniformly regarded by the other
      classes of the community, and the obstinate resistance they make
      to all measures calculated to arrest the violence of these
      combinations, in consequence of the expense with which they would
      probably be attended&mdash;a supineness which, by leaving the
      coast constantly clear to the terrors of such associations, and
      promising impunity to their crimes, operates as a continual
      bounty on their recurrence.</p>

      <p>Infant labour, unhappily now so frequent in all kinds of
      factories, and the great prevalence of female workers, is another
      evil of a very serious kind in the manufacturing districts. We do
      not propose to enter into the question, recently so fiercely
      agitated in the legislature, as to the practicability of
      substituting a compulsory ten-hours' bill for the twelve hours'
      at present in operation. Anxious to avoid all topics on which
      there is a difference of opinion among able and patriotic men, we
      merely state this prevalence and precocity of juvenile labour in
      the manufacturing and mining districts as <i>a fact</i> which all
      must deplore, and which is attended with the most unhappy effects
      on the rising generation. The great majority, probably
      nine-tenths, of all the workers in cotton-mills or printfields,
      are females. We have heard much of the profligacy and
      licentiousness which pervade such establishments; but though that
      may be too true in some cases, it is far from being universal, or
      even general; and there are numerous instances of female virtue
      being as jealously guarded and effectually preserved in such
      establishments, as in the most secluded rural districts. The real
      evils&mdash;and they follow universally from such employment of
      juvenile females in great numbers in laborious but lucrative
      employment&mdash;are the emancipation of the young from parental
      control, the temptation held out to idleness in the parents from
      the possibility of living on their children, and the
      disqualifying the girls for performing all the domestic duties of
      wives and mothers in after life.</p>

      <p>These evils are real, general, and of ruinous consequence.
      When children&mdash;from the age of nine or ten in some
      establishments, of thirteen or fourteen in all&mdash;are able to
      earn wages varying from 3s. 6d. to 6s. a-week, they soon become
      in practice independent of parental control. The strongest of all
      securities for filial obedience&mdash;a sense of
      dependence&mdash;is destroyed. The children assert the right of
      self-government, because they bear the burden of
      self-maintenance. Nature, in the ordinary case, has effectually
      guarded against this premature and fatal emancipation of the
      young, by the protracted period of weakness during childhood and
      adolescence, which precludes the possibility of serious labour
      being undertaken before the age when a certain degree of mental
      firmness has been acquired. But the steam-engine, amidst its
      other marvels, has entirely destroyed, within the sphere of its
      influence, this happy and necessary exemption of infancy from
      labour. Steam is the moving power; it exerts the strength; the
      human machine is required only to lift a web periodically, or
      damp a roller, or twirl a film round the finger, to which the
      hands of infancy are as adequate as those of mature age. Hence
      the general employment of children, and especially girls, in such
      employments. They are equally serviceable as men or women, and
      they are more docile, cheaper, and less given to strikes. But as
      these children earn their own subsistence, they soon become
      rebellious to parental authority, and exercise the freedom of
      middle life as soon as they feel its passions, and before they
      have acquired its self-control.</p>

      <p>If the effect of such premature emancipation of the young is
      hurtful to them, it is, if possible, still more pernicious to
      their parents. Labour is generally irksome to man; it is seldom
      persevered in after the period of its necessity has passed. When
      parents find that, by sending three or four children out to the
      mills or into the mines, they can get eighteen or twenty
      shillings a-week without doing any thing themselves, they soon
      come to abridge the duration and cost of education, in order to
      accelerate the arrival of the happy period when they <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg010" id="pg010">010</a></span>may live on
      their offspring, not their offspring on them. Thus the purest and
      best affections of the heart are obliterated on the very
      threshold of life. That best school of disinterestedness and
      virtue, the <i>domestic hearth</i>, where generosity and
      self-control are called forth in the parents, and gratitude and
      affection in the children, from the very circumstance of the
      dependence of the latter on the former, is destroyed. It is worse
      than destroyed, it is made the parent of wickedness: it exists,
      but it exists only to nourish the selfish and debasing passions.
      Children come to be looked on, not as objects of affection, but
      as instruments of gain; not as forming the first duty of life and
      calling forth its highest energies, but as affording the first
      means of relaxing from labour, and permitting a relapse into
      indolence and sensuality. The children are, practically speaking,
      sold for slaves, and&mdash;oh! unutterable horror!&mdash;<i>the
      sellers are their own parents</i>! Unbounded is the
      demoralization produced by this monstrous perversion of the first
      principles of nature. Thence it is that it is generally found,
      that all the beneficent provisions of the legislature for the
      protection of infant labour are so generally evaded, as to render
      it doubtful whether any law, how stringent soever, could protect
      them. The reason is apparent. The parents of the children are the
      chief violators of the law; for the sake of profit they send them
      out, the instant they can work, to the mills or the mines. Those
      whom nature has made their protectors, have become their
      oppressors. The thirst for idleness, intoxication, or sensuality,
      has turned the strongest of the generous, into the most malignant
      of the selfish passions.</p>

      <p>The habits acquired by such precocious employment of young
      women, are not less destructive of their ultimate utility and
      respectability in life. Habituated from their earliest years to
      one undeviating mechanical employment, they acquire great skill
      in it, but grow up utterly ignorant of any thing else. We speak
      not of ignorance of reading or writing, but of ignorance in still
      more momentous particulars, with reference to their usefulness in
      life as wives and mothers. They can neither bake nor brew, wash
      nor iron, sew nor knit. The finest London lady is not more
      utterly inefficient than they are, for any other object but the
      one mechanical occupation to which they have been habituated.
      They can neither darn a stocking nor sew on a button. As to
      making porridge or washing a handkerchief, the thing is out of
      the question. Their food is cooked out of doors by persons who
      provide the lodging-houses in which they dwell&mdash;they are
      clothed from head to foot, like fine ladies, by milliners and
      dressmakers. This is not the result of fashion, caprice, or
      indolence, but of the entire concentration of their faculties,
      mental and corporeal, from their earliest years, in one limited
      mechanical object. They are unfit to be any man's
      wife&mdash;still more unfit to be any child's mother. We hear
      little of this from philanthropists or education-mongers; but it
      is, nevertheless, not the least, because the most generally
      diffused, evil connected with our manufacturing industry.</p>

      <p>But by far the greatest cause of the mass of crime of the
      manufacturing and mining districts of the country, is to be found
      in the prodigious number of persons, especially in infancy, who
      are reduced to a state of destitution, and precipitated into the
      very lowest stations of life, in consequence of the numerous ills
      to which all flesh&mdash;but especially all flesh in
      manufacturing communities&mdash;is heir. Our limits preclude the
      possibility of entering into all the branches of this immense
      subject; we shall content ourselves, therefore, with referring to
      one, which seems of itself perfectly sufficient to explain the
      increase of crime, which at first sight appears so alarming. This
      is the immense proportion of <i>destitute widows with
      families</i>, who in such circumstances find themselves immovably
      fixed in places where they can neither bring up their children
      decently, nor get away to other and less peopled localities.</p>

      <p>From the admirable statistical returns of the condition of the
      labouring poor in France, prepared for the <i>Bureau de
      l'Intérieure</i>, it appears that the number of widows in that
      country amounts to the enormous number of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg011" id=
      "pg011">011</a></span>1,738,000.<sup>10</sup> This, out of a
      population now of about 34,000,000, is as nearly as possible
      <i>one in twenty</i> of the entire population! Population is
      advancing much more rapidly in Great Britain than France; for in
      the former country it is doubling in about 60 years, in the
      latter in 106. It is certain, therefore, that the proportion of
      widows must be greater in this country than in France, especially
      in the manufacturing districts, where early marriages, from the
      ready employment for young children, are so frequent; and early
      deaths, from the unhealthiness of employment or contagious
      disorders, are so common. But call the proportion the same: let
      it be taken at a twentieth part of the existing population. At
      this rate, the two millions of strangers who, during the last
      forty years, have been thrown into the four northern counties of
      Lancaster, York, Stafford, and Warwick, must contain at this
      moment <i>a hundred thousand widows</i>. The usual average of a
      family is two and a half children&mdash;call it two only. There
      will thus be found to be 200,000 children belonging to these
      100,000 widows. It is hardly necessary to say, that the great
      majority, probably four-fifths of this immense body, must be in a
      state of destitution. We know in what state the fatherless and
      widows are in their affliction, and who has commanded us to visit
      them. On the most moderate calculation, 250,000, or an eighth of
      the whole population, must be in a state of poverty and
      privation. And in Scotland, where, during the same period of
      forty years, 350,000 strangers have been suddenly huddled
      together on the banks of the Clyde, the proportion may be
      presumed to be the same; or, in other words, <i>thirty
      thousand</i> widows and orphans are constantly there in a state
      deserving of pity, and requiring support, hardly any of whom
      receive more from the parish funds than <i>a shilling a-week</i>,
      even for the maintenance of a whole family.</p>

      <p>The proportion of widows and orphans to the entire population,
      though without doubt in some degree aggravated by the early
      marriages and unhealthy employments incident to manufacturing
      districts, may be supposed to be not materially different in one
      age, or part of the country, from another. The widow and the
      orphan, as well as the poor, will be always with us; but the
      peculiar circumstance which renders their condition so deplorable
      in the dense and suddenly peopled manufacturing districts is,
      that the poor have been brought together in such prodigious
      numbers that all the ordinary means of providing for the relief
      of such casualties fails; while the causes of mortality among
      them are periodically so fearful, as to produce a vast and sudden
      increase of the most destitute classes altogether outstripping
      all possible means of local or voluntary relief. During the late
      typhus fever in Glasgow, in the years 1836 and 1837, above 30,000
      of the poor took the epidemic, of whom 3300 died.<sup>11</sup> In
      the first eight months of 1843 alone, 32,000 persons in Glasgow
      were seized with fever.<sup>12</sup> Out of 1000 families, at a
      subsequent period, visited by the police, in conjunction with the
      visitors for the distribution of the great fund raised by
      subscription in 1841, 680 were found to be widows, who, with
      their families, amounted to above 2000 persons all in the most
      abject state of wretchedness and want.<sup>13</sup> On so vast a
      scale do the causes of human destruction <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg012" id="pg012">012</a></span>and
      demoralization act, when men are torn up from their native seats
      by the irresistible magnet of commercial wealth, and congregated
      together in masses, resembling rather the armies of Timour and
      Napoleon than any thing else ever witnessed in the transactions
      of men.</p>

      <p>Here, then, is the great source of demoralization,
      destitution, and crime in the manufacturing districts. It arises
      from the sudden congregation of human beings in such fearful
      multitudes together, that all the usual alleviations of human
      suffering, or modes of providing for human indigence, entirely
      fail. We wonder at the rapid increase of crime in the
      manufacturing districts, forgetting that a squalid mass of two or
      three hundred thousand human beings are constantly precipitated
      to the bottom of society in a few counties, in such circumstances
      of destitution that recklessness and crime arise naturally, it
      may almost be said unavoidably, amongst them. And it is in the
      midst of such gigantic causes of evil&mdash;of causes arising
      from the extraordinary and unparalleled influx of mankind into
      the manufacturing districts during the last forty years, which
      can bear a comparison to nothing but the collection of the host
      with which Napoleon invaded Russia, or Timour and Genghis Khan
      desolated Asia&mdash;that we are gravely told that it is to be
      arrested by education and moral training; by infant schools and
      shortened hours of labour; by multiplication of ministers and
      solitary imprisonment! All these are very good things; each in
      its way is calculated to do a certain amount of good; and their
      united action upon the whole will doubtless, in process of time,
      produce some impression upon the aspect of society, even in the
      densely peopled manufacturing districts. As to their producing
      any immediate effect, or in any sensible degree arresting the
      prodigious amount of misery, destitution, and crime which
      pervades them, you might as well have tried, by the schoolmaster,
      to arrest the horrors of the Moscow retreat.</p>

      <p>That the causes which have now been mentioned are the true
      sources of the rapid progress of crime and general demoralization
      of our manufacturing and mining districts, must be evident to all
      from this circumstance, well known to all who are practically
      conversant with the subject, but to a great degree unattended to
      by the majority of men, and that is,&mdash;that the prodigious
      stream of depravity and corruption which prevails, is far from
      being equally and generally diffused through society, even in the
      densely peopled districts where it is most alarming, but is in a
      great degree confined to the <i>very lowest class</i>. It is from
      that lowest class that nine-tenths of the crime, and nearly all
      the professional crime, which is felt as so great an evil in
      society, flows. Doubtless in all classes there are some wicked,
      many selfish and inhumane men; and a beneficent Deity, in the
      final allotment of rewards and punishments, will take largely
      into account both the opportunities of doing well which the
      better classes have abused, and the almost invincible causes
      which so often chain, as it were, the destitute to recklessness
      and crime. But still, in examining the classes of society on
      which the greater part of the crime comes, it will be found that
      at least three-fourths, probably nine-tenths, comes from the very
      lowest and the most destitute. It is incorrect to say crime is
      common among them; in truth, among the young at least, a tendency
      to it is there all but universal. If we examine who it is that
      compose this dismal substratum, this hideous <i>black band of
      society</i>, we shall find that it is not made up of any one
      class more than another&mdash;not of factory workers more than
      labourers, carters, or miners&mdash;but is formed by an aggregate
      of the most unfortunate or improvident of <i>all classes</i>,
      who, variously struck down from better ways by disease, vice, or
      sensuality, are now of necessity huddled together by tens of
      thousands in the dens of poverty, and held by the firm bond of
      necessity in the precincts of contagion and crime. Society in
      such circumstances resembles the successive bands of which the
      imagination of Dante has framed the infernal regions, which
      contain one concentric circle of horrors and punishments within
      another, until, when you arrive at the bottom, you find one
      uniform mass of crime, blasphemy and suffering. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg013" id="pg013">013</a></span> We are
      persuaded there is no person practically acquainted with the
      causes of immorality and crime in the manufacturing districts,
      who will not admit that these are the true ones; and that the
      others, about which so much is said by theorists and
      philanthropists, though not without influence, are nevertheless
      trifling in the balance. And what we particularly call the public
      attention to is this&mdash;Suppose all the remedies which
      theoretical writers or practical legislators have put forth and
      recommended, as singly adequate to remove the evils of the
      manufacturing classes, were to be in <i>united</i> operation,
      they would still leave these gigantic causes of evil untouched.
      Let Lord Ashley obtain from a reluctant legislature his
      ten-hours' bill, and Dr Chalmers have a clergyman established for
      every 700 inhabitants; let church extension be pushed till there
      is a chapel in every village, and education till there is a
      school in every street; let the separate system be universal in
      prisons, and every criminal be entirely secluded from vicious
      contamination; still the great fountains of evil will remain
      unclosed; still 300,000 widows and orphans will exist in a few
      counties of England amidst a newly collected and strange
      population, steeped in misery themselves, and of necessity
      breeding up their children in habits of destitution and
      depravity; still the poor will be deprived, from the suddenness
      of their collection, and the density of their numbers, of any
      effective control, either from private character or the opinion
      of neighbourhood; still individual passion will be inflamed, and
      individual responsibility lost amidst multitudes; still strikes
      will spread their compulsory idleness amidst tens of thousands,
      and periodically array the whole working classes under the
      banners of sedition, despotism, and murder; still precocious
      female labour will at once tempt parents into idleness in middle
      life, and disqualify children, in youth, for household or
      domestic duties. We wish well to the philanthropists: we are far
      from undervaluing either the importance or the utility of their
      labours; but as we have hitherto seen no diminution of crime
      whatever from their efforts, so we anticipate a very slow and
      almost imperceptible improvement in society from their
      exertions.</p>

      <p>Strong, and in many respects just, pictures of the state of
      the working classes in the manufacturing districts, have been
      lately put forth, and the <i>Perils of the Nation</i> have, with
      reason, been thought to be seriously increased by them. Those
      writers, however, how observant and benevolent soever, give a
      partial, and in many respects fallacious view, of the
      <i>general</i> aspect of society. After reading their doleful
      accounts of the general wretchedness, profligacy, and
      licentiousness of the working classes, the stranger is
      astonished, on travelling through England, to behold green fields
      and smiling cottages on all sides; to see in every village signs
      of increasing comfort, in every town marks of augmented wealth,
      and the aspect of poverty almost banished from the land. Nay,
      what is still more gratifying, the returns of the sanatary
      condition of the whole population, though still exhibiting a
      painful difference between the health and chances of life in the
      rural and manufacturing districts, present unequivocal proof of a
      general amelioration of the chances of life, and, consequently,
      of the general wellbeing of the whole community.</p>

      <p>How are these opposite statements and appearances to be
      reconciled? Both are true&mdash;the reconciliation is easy. The
      misery, recklessness, and vice exist chiefly in one
      class&mdash;the industry, sobriety, and comfort in another. Each
      observer tells truly what he sees in his own circle of attention;
      he does not tell what, nevertheless, exists, and exercises a
      powerful influence on society, of the good which exists in the
      other classes. If the evils detailed in Lord Ashley's speeches,
      and painted with so much force in the <i>Perils of the
      Nation</i>, were universal, or even general, society could not
      hold together for a week. But though these evils are great,
      sometimes overwhelming in particular districts, they are far from
      being general. Nothing effectual has yet been done to arrest them
      in the localities or communities where they arise; but they do
      not spread much beyond them. The person engaged in the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg014" id=
      "pg014">014</a></span>factories are stated by Lord Ashley to be
      between four and five hundred thousand: the population of the
      British islands is above 27,000,000. It is in the steadiness,
      industry, and good conduct of a large proportion of this immense
      majority that the security is to be found. Observe that
      industrious and well-doing majority; you would suppose there is
      no danger:&mdash;observe the profligate and squalid minority; you
      would suppose there is no hope.</p>

      <p>At present about 60,000 persons are annually committed, in the
      British islands, for serious offences<sup>14</sup> worthy of
      deliberate trial, and above double that number for summary or
      police offences. A hundred and eighty thousand persons annually
      fall under the lash of the criminal law, and are committed for
      longer or shorter periods to places of confinement for
      punishment. The number is prodigious&mdash;it is frightful. Yet
      it is in all only about 1 in 120 of the population; and from the
      great number who are repeatedly committed during the same year,
      the individuals punished are not 1 in 200. Such as they are, it
      may safely be affirmed that four-fifths of this 180,000 comes out
      of two or three millions of the community. We are quite sure that
      150,000 come from 3,000,000 of the lowest and most squalid of the
      empire, and not 30,000 from the remaining 24,000,000 who live in
      comparative comfort. This consideration is fitted both to
      encourage hope and awaken shame&mdash;hope, as showing from how
      small a class in society the greater part of the crime comes, and
      to how limited a sphere the remedies require to be applied;
      shame, as demonstrating how disgraceful has been the apathy,
      selfishness, and supineness in the other more numerous and better
      classes, around whom the evil has arisen, but who seldom
      interfere, except to RESIST all measures calculated for its
      removal.</p>

      <p>It is to this subject&mdash;the ease with which the
      extraordinary and unprecedented increase of crime in the empire
      might be arrested by proper means and the total inefficiency of
      all the remedies hitherto attempted, from the want of practical
      knowledge on the part of those at the head of affairs, and an
      entirely false view of human nature in society generally, that we
      shall direct the attention of our readers in a future Number.</p>

      <h2>MEMORANDUMS OF A MONTH'S TOUR IN SICILY.</h2>

      <h3>THE MUSEUM OF PALERMO.</h3>

      <p>The museum of Palermo is a small but very interesting
      collection of statues and other sculpture, gathered chiefly, they
      say, from the ancient temples of Sicily, with a few objects
      bestowed out of the superfluities of Pompeii. In the lower room
      are some good bas-reliefs, to which a story is attached. They
      were discovered fifteen years ago at <i>Selinuntium</i> by some
      young Englishmen, the reward of four months' labour. Our guide,
      who had been also theirs, had warned them not to stay after the
      month of June, when malaria begins. They did stay. All (four)
      took the fever; one died of it in Palermo, and the survivors were
      deprived by the government&mdash;that is, by the king&mdash;of
      the spoils for which they had suffered so much and worked so
      hard. No one is permitted to excavate without royal license;
      <i>excavation</i> is, like <i>Domitian's fish, res fisci</i>.
      Even Mr Fagan, who was consul at Palermo, having made some
      interesting underground discoveries, was deprived of them. We saw
      here a fine Esculapius, in countenance and expression exceedingly
      like the <i>Ecce Homo</i> of Leonardo da Vinci, with all that
      god-like compassion which the great painter had imparted without
      any sacrifice of dignity. He holds a poppy-head, which we do not
      recollect on his statue or gems, and the Epidaurian snake is at
      his side. Up-stairs we saw specimens of fruits from Pompeii,
      barley, beans, the carob pod, pine kernels, as well as bread,
      sponge, linen: and the sponge was obviously such, and so was the
      linen. A bronze Hercules treading on the back of a stag, which he
      has overtaken and subdued, is justly considered as one of the
      most perfect bronzes discovered at Pompeii. A head of our
      Saviour, by Corregio, is exquisite in conception, and such as
      none but a person long familiar with the physiognomy of suffering
      could have accomplished. These are exceptions rather than
      specimens. The pictures, in general, are poor in interest; and a
      long gallery of <i>casts</i> of the <i>chef-d'oeuvres</i> of
      antiquity possessed by the capitals of Italy, Germany, England,
      and France, looks oddly here, and shows the poverty of a country
      which had been to the predatory proconsuls of Rome an
      inexhaustible repertory of the highest treasures of art. A VERRES
      REDIVIVUS would now find little to carry off but toys made of
      amber, lava snuff-boxes, and WODEHOUSE'S MARSALA&mdash;one of
      which he certainly would not guess the <i>age</i> of, and the
      other of which he would not <i>drink</i>.</p>

      <h3>LUNATIC ASYLUM.</h3>

      <p>We saw nothing in this house or its arrangements to make us
      think it superior, or very different from others we had visited
      elsewhere. The making a lunatic asylum a show-place for strangers
      is to be censured; indeed, we heard Esquirol observe, that
      nothing was so bad as the admission of many persons to see the
      patients at all; for that, although some few were better for the
      visits of friends, it was injurious as a general rule to give
      even friends admittance, and that it ought to be left
      discretionary with the physician, <i>when</i> to admit, and
      <i>whom</i>. Cleanliness, good fare, a garden, and the
      suppression of all violence&mdash;these have become immutable
      canons for the conduct of such institutions, and fortunately
      demand little more than ordinary good feeling and intelligence in
      the superintendent. But we could not fail to observe a sad want
      of suitable inducement to <i>occupation</i>, which was apparent
      throughout this asylum. That not above one in ten could read, may
      perhaps be thought a light matter, for few can be the resources
      of insanity in books; yet we saw at <i>Genoa</i> a case where it
      had taken that turn, and as it is occupation to read, with how
      much profit it matters not. Not one woman in four, as usually
      occurs in insanity, could be induced <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg021" id="pg021">021</a></span>to <i>dress
      according to her sex</i>; they figured away in men's coats and
      hats! The dining-room was hung with portraits of some merit, by
      one of the lunatics; and we noticed that every face, if indeed
      all are <i>portraits</i>, had some insanity in it. They have a
      dance every Sunday evening. What an exhibition it must be!</p>

      <h3>MISCELLANEA.</h3>

      <p>That the vegetation of Palermo excels that of Naples, partly
      depends on the superior intelligence of the agriculturist, and
      partly upon soil and climate: the fruits here are not only more
      advanced, but finer in quality. We left a very meagre dessert of
      cherries beginning to ripen at Naples; the very next day, a
      superabundance of very fine and mature ones were to be had on all
      the stalls of Palermo. This must be the result of industry and
      care in a great measure; for on leaving that city, after a
      <i>séjour</i> of three weeks, for Messina, Catania, and Syracuse,
      although summer was much further advanced, we relapsed into
      miserably meagre supplies of what we had eaten in perfection in
      the capital; yet Syracuse and Catania are much warmer than
      Palermo.</p>

      <p>The vegetables here are of immense growth. The fennel root
      (and there is no better test of your whereabouts in Italy) is
      nearly twice as large as at Naples, and weighs, accordingly,
      nearly double. The cauliflowers are quite colossal; and they have
      a blue cabbage so big that your arms will scarcely embrace it. We
      question, however, whether this hypertrophy of fruit or
      vegetables improves their flavour; give us <i>English
      vegetables</i>&mdash;ay, and <i>English fruit</i>. Though
      Smyrna's <i>fig</i> is eaten throughout Europe, and Roman
      <i>brocoli</i> be without a rival; though the <i>cherry</i> and
      the Japan <i>medlar</i> flourish only at Palermo, and the
      <i>cactus</i> of Catania can be eaten nowhere else; what country
      town in England is not better off on the whole, if quality alone
      be considered? But we have one terrible drawback; for <i>whom</i>
      are these fruits of the earth produced? Our <i>prices</i> are
      enormous, and our supply scanty; could we <i>forget this</i>, and
      the artichoke, the asparagus, the peas and beans of London and
      Paris, are rarely elsewhere so fine. To our palates the
      <i>gooseberry</i> and the <i>black currant</i> are a sufficient
      indemnity to Britain for the <i>grape</i>, merely regarded as a
      fruit to <i>eat. Pine-apples</i>, those "illustrious foreigners,"
      are so successfully <i>petted</i> at home, that they will
      scarcely condescend now to flourish out of England.
      <i>Nectarines</i> refuse to ripen, and <i>apricots</i> to have
      any taste elsewhere. Our <i>pears</i> and <i>apples</i> are
      better, and of more various excellence, than any in the world.
      And we really prefer our very figs, grown on a fine
      <i>prebendal</i> wall in the close of <i>Winchester</i>, or under
      <i>Pococke's</i> window in a canon's garden at <i>chilly
      Oxford</i>. Thus has the kitchen-garden refreshed our patriotism,
      and made us half ashamed of our long forgetfulness of home. But
      there are good things abroad too for poor men; the rich may live
      any where. An enormous salad, crisp, cold, white, and of
      delicious flavour, for a halfpenny; olive oil, for fourpence a
      pound, to dress it with; and wine for fourpence a gallon to make
      it disagree with you;<sup>15</sup> fuel for almost nothing, and
      bread for little, are not small advantages to frugal
      housekeepers; but, when dispensed by a despotic government, where
      one must read those revolting words <i>motu proprio</i> at the
      head of every edict, let us go back to our carrots and potatoes,
      our Peels and our income-tax, our fogs and our frost. The country
      mouse came to a right conclusion, and did not like the fragments
      of the feast with the cat in the cupboard&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>Give me again my hollow tree,</p>

        <p>My crust of bread, and liberty."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>15:</p>

        <div class="poem">
          <p>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Lactuca</i> innatat acri</p>

          <p>Post vinum stomacho.&mdash;HOR.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Fish, though plentiful and various, is not fine in any part of
      the <i>Mediterranean</i>; and as to <i>thunny</i>, one surfeit
      would put it out of the bill of fare for life. On the whole,
      though at Palermo and Naples the pauper starves not in the
      streets, the gourmand would be sadly at a loss in his requisition
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg022" id="pg022">022</a></span>of
      delicacies and variety. Inferior bread, at a penny a pound, is
      here considered palatable by the sprinkling over of the crust
      with a small rich seed (<i>jugulena</i>) which has a flavour like
      the almond; it is also strewn, like our caraway seeds in
      biscuits, <i>into</i> the paste, and is largely cultivated for
      that single use. The <i>capsici</i>, somewhat similar in flavour
      to the pea, are detached from the radicles of a plant with a
      flower strikingly like the potatoe, and is used for a similar
      purpose to the jugulena.</p>

      <p>This island was the granary of Athens before it nourished
      Rome; and wheat appears to have been first raised in Europe on
      the plains of eastern Sicily. In Cicero's time it returned
      eightfold; and to this day one grain yields its eightfold of
      increase; which, however, is by a small fraction less than our
      own, as given by M'Culloch in his "Dictionary of Commerce." We
      plucked some <i>siligo</i>, or bearded wheat, near Palermo, the
      beard of which was eight inches long, the ear contained sixty
      grains, eight being also in this instance the average increase;
      how many grains, then, must perish in the ground!</p>

      <p>In Palermo, English gunpowder is sold by British sailors at
      the high price of from five to seven shillings per English pound;
      the "Polvere <i>nostrale</i>" of the Sicilians only fetches 1s.
      8d.; yet such is the superiority of English gunpowder, that every
      one who has a passion for popping at sparrows, and other
      <i>Italian sports</i>, (complimented by the title of <i>La
      caccia</i>,) prefers the dear article. When they have killed off
      all the robins, and there is not a twitter in <i>the whole
      country</i>, they go to the river side and shoot
      <i>gudgeons</i>.</p>

      <p>The Palermo donkey is the most obliging animal that ever wore
      long ears, and will carry you cheerfully four or five miles an
      hour without whip or other <i>encouragement</i>. The oxen, no
      longer white or cream-coloured, as in Tuscany, were originally
      importations from Barbary, (to which country the Sicilians are
      likewise indebted for the <i>mulberry</i> and <i>silk-worm</i>.)
      Their colour is brown. They rival the Umbrian breed in the
      herculean symmetry of their form, and in the possession of horns
      of more than Umbrian dimensions, rising more perpendicularly over
      the forehead than in that ancient race. The lizards here are such
      beautiful creatures, that it is worth while to bring one away,
      and, to <i>pervert</i> a quotation, "UNIUS <i>Dominum sese
      fecisse</i> LACERTAE." Some are all green, some mottled like a
      mosaic floor, others green and black on the upper side, and
      orange-coloured or red underneath. Of snakes, there is a
      <i>Coluber niger</i> from four to five feet in length, with a
      shining coat, and an eye not pleasant to watch even through
      glass; yet the peasants here put them into their Phrygian
      bonnets, and handle them with as much <i>sang-froid</i> as one
      would a walking-stick.</p>

      <p>The coarse earthen vessels, pitchers, urns, &amp;c., used by
      the peasants, are of the most beautiful shapes, often that of the
      ancient <i>amphora</i>; and at every cottage door by the
      road-side you meet with this vestige of the ancient arts of the
      country.</p>

      <p>The plague which visited Palermo in 1624 swept away 20,000
      inhabitants; Messina, in 1743, lost 40,000. The cholera, in 1837,
      destroyed 69,253 persons. The present population of the whole
      island is 1,950,000; the female exceeds the male by about three
      per cent, which is contrary to the general rule. It is said that
      nearly one-half the children received into the foundling hospital
      of Palermo die within the first year.</p>

      <p>Formerly the barons of Sicily were rich and independent, like
      our English gentlemen; but they say that, since 1812, the king's
      whole pleasure and business, as before our <i>Magna Charta</i>
      times, have been to lower their importance. In that year a revolt
      was the consequence of an income-tax even of two per cent, for
      they were yet unbroken to the yoke; but now that he has saddled
      property with a deduction, <i>said</i> to be eventually equal to
      fifteen per cent, if not more; now that he doubles the impost on
      the native sulphur, which is therefore checked in its sale; now
      that he keeps an army of 80,000 men to play at soldiers with; now
      that he constitutes himself the only referee even in questions of
      commercial expediency, and <i>a fortiori</i> in all other cases,
      which he settles <i>arbitrarily</i>, or does not settle at all;
      now that he sees so little the signs of the times, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg023" id="pg023">023</a></span>that he will
      not let a professor go to a science-congress at Florence or
      Bologna without an express permission, and so ignorant as to have
      <i>refused</i> that permission for fear of a political bias; now
      that he diverts a nation's wealth from works of charity or
      usefulness, to keep a set of foreigners in his pay&mdash;they no
      doubt here remember in their prayers, with becoming gratitude,
      "the holy alliance," or, as we would call it, the <i>mutual
      insurance company of the kings of Europe</i>, of which
      Castlereagh and Metternich were the honorary secretaries.</p>

      <p>In the midst of all the gloomy despotism, beautiful even as
      imagination can paint it, is Palermo beautiful! One eminent
      advantage it possesses over Naples itself&mdash;its vicinity
      presents more "drives;" and all the drives here might contest the
      name given to one of them, which is called "<i>Giro delle
      Grazie</i>," (the Ring or Mall of the Graces.) It has a
      <i>Marina</i> of unrivaled beauty, to which the noblesse and the
      citizens repair and form a promenade of elegant equipages. A fine
      pavement for foot passengers is considerately raised three or
      four feet above the carriage road; so that the walking population
      have nothing to annoy them. The sea is immediately below both,
      and you see the little rock-encircled bays animated with groups
      of those sturdy fishermen with bare legs; which you admire in
      Claude and Salvator, throwing before them, with admirable
      precision, their <i>épervier</i> net, whose fine wrought meshes
      sometimes hang, veil-like, between you and the ruddy sunset, or
      plashing, as they fall nightly into the smooth sea, contribute
      the pleasure of an agreeable sound to the magic of the scenery.
      Some take the air on donkeys, which go at a great rate; some are
      mounted on Spanish mules, all mixed together freely amidst
      handsome and numerous equipages; and the whole is backed by a
      fine row of houses opposite the sea, built after the fashion of
      our terraces and crescents at watering-places. And finally, that
      blue <i>æquor</i>, as it now deserves to be termed, studded over
      with thunny boats and coasting craft with the haze latine sail,
      that we should be sorry to trust in British hands, is walled in
      by cliffs so bold, so rugged, and standing out so beautifully in
      relief, that for a moment we cannot choose but envy the citizen
      of <i>Panormus</i>. But we may not tarry even here; <i>we have
      more things</i> to see, and every day is getting hotter than the
      last.</p>

      <h3>JOURNEY TO SEGESTE.</h3>

      <p>Leaving Palermo early, we pass <i>Monreale</i> in our way to
      the Doric columns of <i>Segeste</i>, and find ourselves, before
      the heat of day has reached its greatest intensity, at a
      considerable elevation above the plain on which the capital
      stands, amidst mountains which, except in the difference of their
      vegetation, remind us not a little of the configuration of
      certain wild parts of the Highlands, where Ben Croachin flings
      his dark shadow across Loch Awe. Indeed, we were thinking of this
      old and favourite fishing haunt with much complacency, when two
      men suddenly came forth from behind the bristly aloes and the
      impenetrable cactus&mdash;ill-looking fellows were they; but,
      moved by the kindest intentions for our safety, they offer to
      conduct us through the remainder of the defile. This service our
      hired attendant from Palermo declined, and we push on unmolested
      to Partenico, our halting-place during the heat of the day. It is
      a town of some extent, large enough to afford two fountains of a
      certain pretension, but execrably dirty within. Twelve thousand
      inhabitants has Partenico, and five churches. Out of its five
      locandas, who shall declare the worst? Of that in which we had
      first taken refuge, (as, in a snow-storm on the Alps, any
      <i>roof</i> is Paradise,) we were obliged to quit the shelter,
      and walk at <i>noon</i>, at <i>midsummer</i>, and in
      <i>Sicily</i>, a good mile <i>up</i> a main street, which,
      beginning in habitations of the dimensions of our almshouses,
      ends in a few huts intolerably revolting, about which troops of
      naked children defy vermin, and encrust themselves in filth. At
      one door we could not help observing that worst form of
      <i>scabies</i>, the <i>gale à grosses bulles;</i> so we had got,
      it appeared, from <i>Scylla</i> into <i>Charybdis</i>, and were
      in the very preserves <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg024" id=
      "pg024">024</a></span>of Sicilian <i>itch</i>, and we
      prognosticate it will spread before the month expires wherever
      human skin is to be found for its entertainment. Partenico lies
      in a scorching plain full of malaria. Having passed the three
      stifling hours of the day here, we proceed on our journey to
      <i>Alcamo</i>, a town of considerable size, which looks
      remarkably well from the plain at the distance of four
      miles&mdash;an impression immediately removed on passing its high
      rampart gate. Glad to escape the miseries with which it threatens
      the <i>détenu</i>, we pass out at the other end, and zigzag down
      a hill of great beauty, and commanding such views of sea and land
      as it would be quite absurd to write about. Already a double row
      of aloë, planted at intervals, marks what is to be your course
      afar off, and is a faithful guide till it lands you in a Sicilian
      plain. This is the highest epithet with which any plain can be
      qualified. This is indeed the month for Sicily. The goddess of
      flowers now wears a morning dress of the newest spring fashion;
      beautifully <i>made up</i> is that dress, nor has she worn it
      long enough for it to be sullied ever so little, or to require
      the washing of a shower. A delicate pink and a rich red are the
      colours which prevail in the tasteful pattern of her voluminous
      drapery; and as she <i>advances</i> on you with a light and
      noiseless step, over a carpet which all the looms of Paris or of
      Persia could not imitate, scattering bouquets of colours the most
      happily contrasted, and impregnating the air with the most
      grateful fragrance, we at once acknowledge her beautiful
      impersonation in that "<i>monument of Grecian art</i>," the
      <i>Farnese Flora</i>, of which we have brought the fresh
      recollection from the museum of Naples.</p>

      <p>The <i>Erba Bianca</i> is a plant like southernwood,
      presenting a curious hoar-frosted appearance as its leaves are
      stirred by the wind. The <i>Rozzolo a vento</i> is an ambitious
      plant, which grows beyond its strength, snaps short upon its
      overburdened stalk, and is borne away by any zephyr, however
      light. Large crops of <i>oats</i> are already cut; and oxen of
      the Barbary breed, brown and coal-black, are already dragging the
      simple aboriginal plough over the land. Some of these fine cattle
      (to whom we are strangers, as they are to us) stood gazing at us
      in the plain, their white horns glancing in the sun; others,
      recumbent and ruminating, exhibit antlers which, as we have said
      before, surpass the Umbrian cattle in their elk-like length and
      imposing majesty. Arrived at the bottom of our long hill, we pass
      a beautiful stream called <i>Fiume freddo</i>, whose source we
      track across the plain by banks crowned with <i>Cactus</i> and
      <i>Tamarisk</i>. Looking back with regret towards <i>Alcamo</i>,
      we see trains of mules, which still transact the internal
      commerce of the country, with large packsaddles on their backs;
      and when a halt takes place, these animals during their drivers'
      dinner obtain their own ready-found meal, and browse away on
      three courses of vegetables and a dessert.</p>

      <h3>SICILIAN INNS.</h3>

      <p>"A beautiful place this <i>Segeste</i> must be! One could
      undergo any thing to see it!" Such would be the probable
      exclamation of more than one reader looking over some
      <i>landscape annual</i>, embellished with perhaps <i>a view</i>
      of the celebrated temple and its surrounding scenery; but find
      yourself at any of the inexpressibly horrid inns of <i>Alcamo</i>
      or <i>Calatafrini</i>, (and these are the two principal stations
      between Palermo and Segeste&mdash;one with its 12,000, the other
      with its 18,000 inhabitants;) let us walk you down the main
      street of either, and if you don't wish yourself at Cheltenham,
      or some other unclassical place which never had a Latin name, we
      are much mistaken! The "<i>Relievo dei Cavalli</i>" at Alcamo
      offers no <i>relief</i> for you! The <i>Magpie</i> may prate on
      her sign-post about <i>clean</i> beds, for magpies can be made to
      say any thing; but pray do not construe the "<i>Canova
      Divina</i>" Divine Canova! <i>He</i> never executed any thing for
      the <i>Red Lion</i> of Calatafrini, whose "Canova" is a low
      wine-shop, full of wrangling Sicilian boors. Or will you place
      yourself under the <i>Eagle's</i> wing, seduced by its <i>nuovi
      mobili e buon servizio</i>? Oh, we obtest those <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg025" id="pg025">025</a></span>broken
      window-panes whether it be not <i>cruel</i> to expose <i>new
      furniture</i> to such perils! For us we put up at the "<i>Temple
      of Segeste</i>," attracted rather by its name than by any promise
      or decoy it offers. Crabbe has given to the inns at Aldborough
      each its character: here all are equal in immundicity, and all
      equally without provisions. Some yellow beans lie soaking to
      soften them. There is salt-cod from the north, moist and putrid.
      There is no milk; eggs are few. The ham at the Pizzicarolo's is
      always bad, and the garlicked sausage repulsive. Nothing is
      painted or white-washed, let alone dusted, swept, or scoured. The
      walls have the appearance of having been <i>pawed</i> over by new
      relays of dirty fingers daily for ten years. This is a very
      peculiar appearance at many nasty places <i>out</i> of Sicily,
      and we really do not know its <i>pathology</i>. You tread
      loathingly an indescribable earthen floor, and your eye, on
      entering the apartment, is arrested by a nameless production of
      the fictile art, certainly not of <i>Etruscan</i> form, which is
      invariably placed on the <i>bolster</i> of the truck-bed destined
      presently for your devoted head. Oh! to do justice to a Sicilian
      <i>locanda</i> is plainly out of question, and the rest of our
      task may as well be sung as said, verse and prose being alike
      incapable of the hopeless reality:&mdash;</p>

      <p>Crossing a rustic bridge, we pass through a garden (for it is
      no less, though man has had no spade in it) of pinks, marigolds,
      cyclamens, and heart's-ease, &amp;c. &amp;c.; the moist meadow
      land below is a perfect jungle of lofty grasses, all fragrant and
      in flower, gemmed with the unevaporated morning dew, and
      colonized with the <i>Aphides, Alticæ</i>, and swarms of the most
      beautiful butterflies clinging to their stalks. <i>Gramina
      læta</i> after Virgil's own heart, were these. Their elegance and
      unusual variety were sufficient to throw a botanist into a
      perfect HAY fever, and our own first paroxysm only went off,
      when, after an hour's hard collecting, we came to a place which
      demanded <i>another</i> sort of enthusiasm; for THERE stood
      without a veil the <i>Temple of Segeste</i>, with <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg026" id="pg026">026</a></span>one or two
      glimpses of which we had been already astonished at a distance,
      in all its Dorian majesty! This almost unmutilated and glorious
      memorial of past ages here reigns alone&mdash;the only building
      far or near visible in the whole horizon; and what a position has
      its architect secured! In the midst of hills on a bit of
      table-land, apparently made such by smoothing down the summit of
      one of them, with a greensward in front, and set off behind by a
      mountain background, stands this eternal monument of the noblest
      of arts amidst the finest dispositions of nature. There is
      another antiquity of the place also to be visited at
      Segeste&mdash;its <i>theatre</i>; but we are too immediately
      below it to know any thing about it at present, and must leave it
      in a parenthesis. To our left, at the distance of eight miles,
      this hill country of harmonious and graceful undulation ends in
      beetling cliffs, beneath which the sea, now full in view, lies
      sparkling in the morning sunshine. We shall never, never forget
      the impressions made upon us on first getting sight of Segeste!
      <i>Pæstum</i> we had seen, and thought that it exhausted all that
      was possible to a temple, or the site of a temple. Awe-stricken
      had we surveyed those monuments of "immemorial antiquity" in that
      baleful region of wild-eyed buffaloes and birds of
      prey&mdash;temples to death in the midst of his undisputed
      domains! We had fully adopted Forsyth's sentiment, and held
      Pæstum to be probably the most impressive monument on earth; but
      here at Segeste a nature less austere, and more RIANTE in its
      wildness, lent a quite different charm to a scene which could
      scarcely be represented by art, and for which a reader could
      certainly not be <i>prepared</i> by description. We gave an
      antiquarian's devoutest worship to this venerable survivor of
      2000 years, and of many empires&mdash;we <i>felt</i> the vast
      masses of its time-tried Doric, and even the wild flowers within
      its precincts, its pink valerians; its <i>erba di vento</i>, its
      scented wallflower. The whole scene kept our admiration long
      tasked, but untired. A smart shower compelled us to seek shelter
      under the shoulder of one of the grey entablatures: it soon
      passed away, leaving us a legacy of the richest fragrance, while
      a number of wild birds of the hawk kind, called "chaoli" from
      their shrill note, issued from their hiding-places, and gave us
      wild music as they scudded by!</p>

      <p>A few bits of wall scattered over the corn-fields are all that
      now remains of the dwellings of the men who built this temple for
      their city, and who, by its splendour, deluded the Athenians into
      a belief of greater wealth than they possessed.</p>

      <p>Our ascent to the theatre, the day after, proved to be a very
      steep one, of half an hour on mule-back; in making which, we
      scared two of those prodigious birds, the <i>ospreys</i>, who,
      having reconnoitred us, forthwith began to wheel in larger and
      larger sweeps, and at last made off for the sea. We found the
      interior of the theatre occupied by an audience ready for our
      arrival; it consisted of innummerable <i>hawks</i>, the chaoli
      just mentioned, which began to scream at our intrusion. The
      ospreys soon returned, and were plainly only waiting our
      departure to subside upon their solitary domain. We would not be
      a soft-billed bird for something in this neighbourhood; no song
      would save them from the hawks' supper. Having luxuriated on the
      24th of May for full four hours in this enchanting neighbourhood,
      we were sorry to return to our inn&mdash;and such an inn! We
      departed abruptly, and probably never to return; but we shall
      think of Segeste in Hyde Park, or as we pass the candlestick
      Corinthians of Whitehall. Thucydides<sup>16</sup> relates that a
      prevailing notion in his time was, that the <i>Trojans</i> after
      losing <i>Troy</i> went first to <i>Sicily</i>, and founded there
      Egesta and Eryx. Now, as on the same authority the first
      <i>Greek</i> colony was <i>Naxos</i>, also in Sicily, Greeks and
      Trojans (strange coincidence!) must have <i>met again</i> on new
      ground after the <i>Iliad</i> was all acted and done with, like a
      tale that is told.</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>16: <i>Vide</i> THUCYDIDES, Book iv. chap. 15.</p>
      </div>

      <p>On our return towards Palermo, one of our party having a touch
      of ague, we crossed the street to the apothecary, (at
      Calatafrini, our night's halt,) and smelling about his musty
      galenicals, amidst a large supply of <i>malvas</i> which were
      drying on his counter, the only wholesome-looking thing amidst
      his stores, we asked if <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg027" id=
      "pg027">027</a></span>he had any <i>quinine</i>. "<i>Sicuro!</i>"
      and he presented us with a white powder having a slightly bitter
      taste, which, together with an ounce of green tea, to be
      dispensed in pinches of five grains on extraordinary occasions,
      comes, he says, from the East. On our observing that the quinine,
      if such at all, was adulterated, and that this was too bad in a
      country of malaria, where it was the poor man's only protection,
      he looked angry; but we rose in the esteem of peasants in the
      shop, who said to each other&mdash;"Ed ha ragione il Signor."
      Wanting a little <i>soda</i>, we were presented with
      sub-carbonate of potash as the nearest approach to it&mdash;a
      substitution which suggested to us a classical recollection from
      Theocritus; namely, that in this same Sicily, 2000 years ago, a
      Syracusan husband is rated by his dame for sending her
      <i>soda</i> for her washing in place of potash, the very converse
      of what our old drug-vender intended to have washed our inside
      withal.</p>

      <p>The Roman Catholic religion patronises painting oddly here;
      not a cart but is adorned with some sacred subject. Every
      wretched vehicle that totters under an unmerciful load, with one
      poor donkey to draw six men, has its picture of <i>Souls in
      Purgatory</i>, who seem putting their hands and heads out of the
      flames, and vainly calling on the ruffians inside to <i>stop</i>.
      We read <i>Viva la Divina Providenza</i>, in flaming characters
      on the front board of a carriole, while the whip is goading the
      poor starved brute who drags it; for these barbarians in the rear
      of European civilization, plainly are of opinion that a cart with
      a sacred device shall not <i>break down</i>, though its owner
      commit every species of cruelty.</p>

      <p>The next day found us again installed at our old quarters in
      Palermo, where, during our brief remaining stay, we visit a
      conchologist, before which event we had no notion that Sicily was
      so rich in shells. Two sides of a moderately large room are
      entirely devoted to his collection. Here we saw a piece of wood
      nearly destroyed by the <i>Teredo navalis</i>, or sailor's bore,
      who seems more active and industrious here than elsewhere, and
      seldom allows himself to be taken whole. Out of hundreds of
      specimens, three or four perfect ones were all that this
      collector could ever manage to extract, the molluscous
      wood-destroyer being very soft and fragile. His length is about
      three inches, his thickness that of a small quill; he lodges in a
      shell of extreme tenuity, and the secretion which he ejects is,
      it seems, the agent which destroys the wood, and pushes on bit by
      bit the winding tunnel. But his doings are nothing to the working
      of another wafer-shelled bivalve, whose tiny habitations are so
      thickly imbedded in the body of a nodule of <i>flint</i> as to
      render its exterior like a sieve, <i>diducit scopulos aceto</i>.
      What solvent can the chemist prepare in his laboratory comparable
      to one which, while it dissolves silex, neither harms the insect
      nor injures its shell. Amongst the <i>fossils</i> we notice
      cockles as big as ostrich eggs, clam-shells twice the size of the
      largest of our Sussex coast, and those of oysters which rival
      soup-plates. We had indeed once before met with them of equal
      size in the lime-beds at <i>Corneto</i>. Judging by the
      <i>oysters</i>, there must indeed have been <i>giants</i> in
      those days. But this collection was chiefly remarkable for its
      curious fossil remains of <i>animals</i> from <i>Monte
      Grifone</i>. In this same Monte Grifone, which we went to visit,
      is one of the largest of the caves of bones of which so many have
      been discovered&mdash;bones of various kinds, some of small, some
      of very large animals, mixed together pell-mell, and constituting
      a fossil paste of scarcely any thing besides. None of the
      geologists, in attempting to explain these deposits, sufficiently
      enter into the question of the origin of the enormous
      <i>quantity</i>, and <i>close juxtaposition</i>, of such
      heterogeneous specimens.</p>

      <p>By eight o'clock we are on board the <i>Palermo</i> steamer,
      which is to convey us hence to <i>Messina</i>. The baked deck,
      which has been saturated with the sun's heat all day, is now
      cooling to a more moderate warmth, and soothing would be the
      scene but for the noise of women and children. Large liquid stars
      twinkle here and there, like so many moons on a reduced scale,
      over the sea, and the night is wholly delightful! A bell rings,
      which diminishes our numbers, and somewhat clears our deck. The
      boats which carry off the last loiterers are gone, shaking
      phosphorus from <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg028" id=
      "pg028">028</a></span>their gills, and leaving a train of it in
      their tails; and the many-windowed Pharos of the harbour has all
      its panes lit up, and twinkles after its own fashion. Round the
      bay an interrupted crescent of flickering light is reflected in
      the water, strongest in the middle, where the town is thickest,
      and runs back; and far behind all lights comes the clear outline
      of the darkly defined mountain rising over the city. Our own
      lantern also is up, the authorities have disappeared, Monte
      Pelegrino begins to change its position, we are in motion, and a
      mighty light we are making under us, as our leviathan, turning
      round her head and <i>snuffing</i> the sea, begins to wind out of
      the harbour. A few minutes more, and the luminous tracery of the
      receding town becomes more and more indistinct; but the sky is
      <i>all stars</i>, and the water, save where we break its
      smoothness, a perfect mirror. Wherever the paddles play, there
      the sea foams up into yellow light and <i>gerbes</i> of
      amber-coloured fireballs, caught up by the wheels, and flung off
      in our track, to float past with incredible rapidity. Men are
      talking the language of Babel in the cabin; there is amateur
      singing and a guitar on deck&mdash;<i>Orion</i> is on his
      dolphin&mdash;adieu, Palermo!</p>

      <h3>APPROACH TO MESSINA.</h3>

      <p>The Italian morning presents a beautiful sight on deck to eyes
      weary and sore with night, as night passes on board steamers. We
      pass along a coast obviously of singular conformation, and to a
      geologist, we suppose, full of interest. We encounter a herd of
      classical dolphins out a-pleasuring. We ask about a pretty little
      town perched just above the sea, and called <i>Giocosa</i>. By
      its side lies <i>Tyndaris</i>&mdash;classical enough if we spell
      it right. The snow on Etna is as good as an inscription, and to
      be read at any distance; but what a deception! they tell us it is
      thirty miles off, and it seems to rise immediately from behind a
      ridge of hills close to the shore. The snow cone rises in the
      midst of other cones, which would appear equally high but for the
      difference of colour. <i>Patti</i> is a picturesque little
      <i>borgo</i>, on the hillside, celebrated in Sicily for its
      manufacture of hardware. In the bay of <i>Melazzo</i> are taken
      by far the largest supplies of thunny in the whole Mediterranean.
      From the embayed town so named you have the choice of a
      cross-road to Messina, (twenty-four miles;) but who would abridge
      distance and miss the celebrated straits towards which we are
      rapidly approaching, or lose one hour on land and miss the
      novelties of volcanic islands, and the first view of Scylla and
      Charybdis? It is but eight o'clock, but the awning has been
      stretched over our heads an hour ago. As to breakfast&mdash;the
      meal which is associated with that particular hour of the
      four-and-twenty to all well regulated <i>minds</i> and
      <i>stomachs</i>&mdash;it consists here of thin <i>veneers</i> of
      old mahogany-coloured thunny, varnished with oil, and relieved by
      an incongruous abomination of capers and olives. The cold fowls
      are infamous. The wine were a disgrace to the sorriest tapster
      between this and the Alps, and also fiery, like every thing else
      in this district. Drink it, and doubt not the old
      result&mdash;<i>de conviva Corybanta videbis</i>. (Oh, for
      muffins and dry toast!) Never mind, we shall soon be at Messina.
      And now we approach a point from which the lofty Calabrian coast
      opposite, and the flinty wall of the formidable Scylla, first
      present themselves, but still as distant objects. In another half
      hour we are just opposite the redoubtable rock; and here we turn
      abruptly at right angles to our hitherto course, and find
      ourselves <i>within</i> the straits, from either side of which
      the English and the French so often tried the effect of cannon
      upon each other. It is now what it used to be&mdash;fishing
      ground. The Romans got their finest muræna from the whirlpools of
      <i>Charybdis</i>.<sup>17</sup> The shark (<i>cane di mare</i>)
      abounding here, would make bathing dangerous were the water
      smooth; but the rapid whirlpools through which our steam-boat
      dashes on disdainfully, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg029" id=
      "pg029">029</a></span>would, at the same time, make it impossible
      to any thing but a fish. A passenger assured us he had once seen
      a man lost in the Vistula, who, from being a great swimmer,
      trusted imprudently to his strength, and was sucked down by a
      vortex of far less impetuosity, he thought, than this through
      which we were moving. From this point till we arrived at Messina,
      as every body was ripe for bathing, the whole conversation turned
      naturally on the Messina shark, and his trick of snapping at
      people's legs carelessly left by the owners dangling over the
      boat's side. We steam up the straits to our anchorage in about
      three-fourths of an hour. The approach is fine, very fine. A
      certain Greek, (count, he called himself,) a great traveller, and
      we afterwards found not a small adventurer, increases the
      interest of the approach, by telling us that the hills before us,
      bubbling up like blisters on chalcedony, have a considerable
      resemblance, though inferior in character, to those which
      embellish the Bosphorus and the first view of Constantinople.
      Inferior, no doubt, in the imposing accessories of mosque and
      minaret, and of cypresses as big as obelisks, which, rising
      thickly on the heights, give to the city of Constantinople an
      altogether peculiar and inimitable charm. Messina is beautifully
      land-locked. The only possible winds that can affect its port are
      the north-west and south-east. In summer it is said to enjoy more
      sea breeze than any other place on the Mediterranean. Our Greek
      friend, however, says that Constantinople is in this respect not
      only superior to Messina, but to any other place in the seas of
      Europe. Pity that the fellows are Turks! We did not find much to
      interest us within the walls of Messina. There was, to be sure, a
      fine collection of Sicilian birds, amongst which we were
      surprised to see several of very exotic shape and plumage. One
      long-legged fellow, dressed in a dirty white Austrian uniform,
      with large web-feet, on which he seemed to rest with great
      complacency, particularly arrested our attention. He stood as
      high as the <i>Venus di Medici</i>, but by no means so
      gracefully, and thrust his thick carved beak unceremoniously in
      your face. His card of address was <i>Phoenicopterus
      antiquorum</i>. The ancients ate him, and he looked as if he
      would break your nose if you disputed with him. A very large
      finch, which we have seen for sale about the streets here and
      elsewhere in Sicily, rejoices in the imposing name of
      <i>Fringilla cocco thraustis</i>. He wears his black cravat like
      a bird of pretension, as he evidently is. The puffin (<i>Puffinus
      Anglorum</i>) also frequents these rocks, though a very long way
      from the Isle of Wight. No! Messina, though very fine, is not
      equal to <i>Palermo</i>, with its unrivaled <i>Marina</i>,
      compared to which Messina is poorly off indeed, in her straggling
      dirty commerce-doing quay. We went out to see a little garden,
      which contains half a dozen zare-trees and as many beautiful
      birds in cages. We are disappointed at the poverty of our dessert
      in this region of fruitfulness&mdash;a few bad oranges, some
      miserable cherries, and that abomination the green almond. We
      observe, for the first time, to-day folks eating in the streets
      the crude contents of a little oval pod, which contains one or
      two very large peas, twice the size of any others. These are the
      true <i>cicer</i>, the proper Italian pea. Little bundles of them
      are tied up for sale at all the fruit stalls, and men are seen
      all the day long eating these raw peas, and offering them to each
      other as sugar-plums.</p>

      <p>In the Corso we see a kind of temporary theatre, the deal
      sides of which are gaudily lined with Catania silk, and on its
      stage a whole <i>dramatis personæ</i> of sacred puppets. It is
      lighted by tapers of very taper dimensions, and its <i>stalle</i>
      are to be let for a humble consideration to the faithful or the
      curious. It turns out to be a religious spectacle, supported on
      the voluntary system&mdash;but there is something for your money.
      A vast quantity of light framework, to which fireworks, chiefly
      of the detonating kind, are attached, are already going off, and
      folk are watching till it be completed. Then the evening's
      entertainment will begin, and a miser indeed must he be, or
      beyond measure resourceless, who refuses halfpence for such
      choice festivities. Desirous to make out the particular
      representation, we get over the fence in order to examine the
      figures of the drama on a nearer view. A smartly dressed saint in
      a court <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg030" id=
      "pg030">030</a></span>suit, but whom mitre and crosier determine
      to be a bishop, kneels to a figure in spangles, a virgin as fond
      of fine clothes as the Greek Panageia; while on the other side,
      with one or two priests in his train, is seen a crowd in civil
      costume. A paper cloud above, surrounded by glories of glass and
      tinsel, is supported by two solid cherubs equal to the occasion,
      and presents to the intelligent a representation of&mdash;we know
      not what! Fire-works here divide the public with the
      drum&mdash;to one or other all advertisement in Sicily is
      committed. A sale of fish and flesh, theatric entertainments,
      processions, and church invitations, are all by tuck of drum, or
      by squib and cracker. How did they get on before the invention of
      gunpowder? If a new coffeehouse is established, a couple of drums
      start it advantageously, and beat like a recruiting party up and
      down the street, to the dismay of all <i>Forestieri</i>. The drum
      tells you when the thunny is at a discount, and <i>fire-works</i>
      are let off at <i>fish stalls</i> when customers are slack.</p>

      <p>An old tower, five miles off, is called the telegraph. People
      go there for the panorama at the expense of three horses and two
      hours; but you are repaid by two sea views, either of which had
      been sufficient. Messina, its harbour, the straits, the opposite
      coast of Calabria, Scylla, and <i>Rhegium</i>, (famed for its
      bergamot,) are on the immediate shore, and a most striking chain
      of hills for the background, which, at a greater distance, have
      for their background the imposing range of the <i>Abruzzi</i>.
      The Æolian islands rise out of the sea in the happiest positions
      for effect. <i>Stromboli</i> on the extreme right detaches his
      grey wreath of smoke, which seems as if it proceeded out of the
      water, (for Stromboli is very low,) staining for a moment the
      clear firmament, which rivals it in depth of colour. Some of the
      volcanic group are so nearly on a level with the water, that they
      look like the backs of so many leviathans at a halt. The sea
      itself lies, a waveless mirror, smooth, shining, slippery, and
      treacherous as a serpent's back&mdash;"miseri quibus intentata
      <i>nites</i>," say we.</p>

      <h3>JOURNEY TO TAORMINA.</h3>

      <p>We left Messina under a sky which no painter would or could
      attempt; indeed, it would not have looked well on paper, or out
      of reality. There are certain unusual, yet magnificent
      appearances in nature, from which the artist conventionally
      abstains, not so much from the impotence of art, as that the
      nearer his approach to success the worse the picture. At one time
      the colours were like shot or clouded silk, or the beautiful
      uncertainty of the Palamida of these shores, or the matrix of
      opal; at another, the Pacific Ocean above, of which the
      continuity is often for whole months <i>entire</i>, was broken
      into gigantic continents and a Polynesia of rose-coloured islands
      that no ships might approach; while in this nether world the
      middle of the Calabro-Sicilian strait was occupied by a
      condensation of vapour, (one could never profane them by the term
      of <i>sea-mist</i> or <i>fog</i>,) the most subtile and
      attenuated which ever came from the realms of cloud-compelling
      Jove. This fleecy tissue pursued its deliberate progress from
      coast to coast, like a cortege of cobwebs carrying a deputation
      from the power-looms of <i>Arachne</i> in <i>Italy</i> to the
      rival silk-looms at Catania. We pass the dry beds of mountain
      torrents at every half mile, ugly gashes on a smooth road; and
      requiring too much caution to leave one's attention to be engaged
      by many objects altogether new and beautiful. The rich yellow of
      the <i>Cactus</i>, and the red of the <i>Pomegranate</i>, and the
      most tender of all vegetable greens, that of the young
      <i>mulberry</i>, together with a sweet wilderness of unfamiliar
      plants, are not to be perfectly enjoyed on a fourfooted animal
      that stumbles, or on a road full of pitfalls. We shall only say
      that the <i>Cynara cardunculus</i>, (a singularly fine thistle or
      <i>wild artichoke</i>;) the prickly uncultivated
      <i>love-apple</i>, (a beautiful variety of the <i>Solanum</i>,)
      of which the decoction is not infrequently employed in nephritic
      complaints; the <i>Ferula</i>, sighing for occupation all along
      the sea-shore, and shaking its scourge as the wind blows; the
      <i>Rhododendron</i>, in full blossom, planted <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg031" id="pg031">031</a></span>amongst the
      shingles; the <i>Thapsia gargarica</i>, with its silver umbel,
      looking at a short distance like mica, (an appearance caused by
      the shining white fringe of the capsule encasing its seed,) and
      many other strange and beautiful things, were the constant
      attendants of our march. We counted six or seven varieties of the
      spurge, (<i>Euphorbium</i>,) each on its milky stem, and in
      passing through the villages had <i>Carnations</i> as large as
      <i>Dahlias</i> flung at us by sunburnt urchins posted at their
      several doors. The sandy shore for many miles is beautifully
      notched in upon by tiny bays like basins, on which boats lie
      motionless and baking in the sun, or oscillate under a
      picturesque rock, immersed up to its shoulders in a green
      <i>hyaloid</i>, which reflects their forms from a depth of many
      fathoms. On more open stretches of the shore, long-drawn ripples
      of waves of tiny dimension are overrunning and treading on one
      another's heels for miles a-head, and tapping the anchored boat
      "with gentle blow." The long-horned oxen already spoken of, toil
      along the seaside road like the horses on our canal banks, and
      tug the heavy felucca towards Messina&mdash;a service, however,
      sometimes executed by men harnessed to the towing-cord, who, as
      they go, offend the Sicilian muses by sounds and by words that
      have little indeed of the &Delta;&omega;&rho;&iota;&zeta;
      &alpha;&omicron;&iota;&delta;&alpha;. The gable ends of cottages
      often exhibit a very primitive windmill for sawing wood within
      doors. It is a large wheel, to the spokes of which flappers are
      adjusted, made of coarse matting, and so placed as to profit by
      the ordinary sea breeze; and, while the <i>wind</i> is thus
      <i>sawing</i> his planks for him, the carpenter, at his door,
      carries on his craft. We pass below not a few fortresses abutting
      over the sea, or perched on the mountain tops. Many of these are
      of English construction, and date from the occupation of the
      island during the French war: in a word, the whole of this
      Sicilian road is so variously lovely, that if we did not know the
      <i>cornice</i> between <i>Nice</i> and <i>Genoa</i>, we should
      say it was quite unrivaled, being at once in lavish possession of
      all the grand, and most of the milder elements of landscape
      composition. It is long since it became no wonder to us that the
      greatest and in fact the only, real pastoral poet should have
      been a Sicilian; but it is a marvel indeed, that, having
      forgotten to bring his <i>Eclogues</i> with us, we cannot,
      through the whole of Sicily, find a copy of Theocitus for sale,
      though there is a <i>Sicilian</i> translation of him to be had at
      Palermo. As he progresses thus delightfully, a long-wished for
      moment awaits the traveller approaching towards
      <i>Giardini</i>&mdash;turning round a far projecting neck of
      land, <i>Etna</i> is at last before him! A disappointment,
      however, on the whole is Etna himself, thus introduced. He looks
      far below his stature, and seems so <i>near</i>, that we would
      have wagered to get upon his shoulders and pull his ears, and
      return to the little town to dine; the ascent also, to the eye,
      seems any thing but steep; nor can you easily be brought to
      believe that such an expedition is from Giardini a three days'
      affair, except, indeed, that yonder belt of snow in the midst of
      this roasting sunshine, has its own interpretation, and cannot be
      mistaken. Alas! In the midst of all our flowers there was, as
      there always is, the <i>amari aliquid</i>&mdash;it was occasioned
      here by the <i>flies</i>. They had tasked our <i>improved</i>
      capacity for bearing annoyances ever since we first set foot in
      Sicily; but <i>here</i> they are perfectly incontrollable,
      stinging and buzzing at us without mercy or truce, not to be
      driven off for a second, nor persuaded to drown themselves on any
      consideration. Verily, the honey-pots of Hybla itself seem to
      please these troublesome insects less than the <i>flesh</i>-pots
      of Egypt.</p>

      <p>The next day begins inauspiciously for our ascent to Taormina;
      but the attendants of the excursion are already making a great
      noise, without which nothing can be done in either of the two
      Sicilies. A supply of shabby donkeys are brought and mounted,
      and, once astride, we begin to ascend, the poor beasts tottering
      under our weight, and by their constant stumbling affording us
      little inclination to look about. It takes about three-fourths of
      an hour of this donkey-riding to reach the old notched wall of
      the town. Two Taorminian citizens at this moment issue from under
      its arch, in their way down, and guessing what we are, offer some
      indifferent coins which do not suit us, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg032" id="pg032">032</a></span>but enable us
      to enter into conversation. We demand and obtain a
      <i>cicerone</i>, of whom we are glad to get rid after three
      hours' infliction of his stupidity and endurance of his
      ignorance, without acquiring one idea, Greek, Roman, Norman, or
      Saracen, out of all his erudition. After going through the whole
      tour with such a fellow for a Hermes, we come at last upon the
      far-famed theatre, where we did not want him. Here, however, a
      very intelligent attendant, supported by the king of Naples on a
      suitable pension of five baiocchi a-day, takes us out of the
      hands of the Philistine, and with a plan of the ground to aid us,
      proceeds to give an intelligible, and, as appears to us, a true
      explanation of the different parts of the huge construction, in
      the area of which we stand delighted. He directed our attention
      to a large arched tunnel, under and at right angles to the
      pulpita, and we did not want direction to the thirty-six niches
      placed at equal distances all round the ellipse, and just over
      the lowest range of the CUNEI. All niches were, no doubt, for
      statues; but these might also have been, it pleases some to
      suppose, for the reverberation of applause; and they quote
      something about <i>"Resonantia Vasa"</i> from Macrobius, adding,
      that such niches were once probably lined with brass. Of bolder
      speculatists, some believe the <i>kennel</i> to have been made
      with a similar intention. Others hold that it may have been a
      concealed way for introducing lions and tigers to the arena! Now,
      what if it were a <i>drain</i> for the waters, which, in bad
      weather, soon collect to a formidable height in such a situation?
      Whether for voice, or wild beasts, or drainage, or none of these
      objects, there it is. As to the first, we cannot help being
      sceptical. Did it ever occur to an audience to wish the noise
      they make <i>greater</i>, and contrive expedients for <i>making
      it so?</i></p>

      <p>We are here high up amidst the mountains, where, we are to
      remember, as the ancients came not to spend, like ourselves, an
      idle hour, but to consume most of the day, <i>shelter</i> would
      be wanted. Two large lateral spaces, or as it were, side
      chambers, have received this destination at the hands of the
      antiquary, and have been supposed lobbies for foul weather or for
      shade at noon. We were made to notice by our guide, what we
      should else have overlooked, how the main passage described above
      communicates with several smaller ones in its progress, and that
      a small stair was a subsequent contrivance or afterthought meant
      to relieve, on emergency, the overcharged large one; its
      workmanship and style showed it plainly to have been added when
      the edifice had already become <i>an antiquity</i>. This
      altogether peculiar and most interesting building has also
      suffered still later interpolations: a Saracenic frieze runs
      round the wall; so that the hands of three widely different
      nations have been busy on the mountain theatre, which received
      its <i>first audience</i> twenty-five centuries ago! The view
      obtained from this spot has often been celebrated, and deserves
      to be. Such mountains we had often seen before; such a sky is the
      usual privilege of Sicily; these indented <i>bays</i>, which
      break so beautifully the line of the coast, had been an object of
      our daily admiration; the hoary side of the majestic Etna, and
      Naxos with its castellated isthmus, might be seen from
      <i>other</i> elevated situations; and the acuminated tops of
      Mola, with its Saracenic tower, were commanded by neighbouring
      sites&mdash;Taormina <i>alone</i>, and for its <i>own</i> sake,
      was the great and paramount object in our eyes, and possessed us
      wholly! We had been following <i>Lyell</i> half the day in
      antediluvian remains; but what are the bones of
      <i>Ichthyosauri</i> or <i>Megalotheria</i> to this gigantic
      skeleton of Doric antiquity, round which lie scattered the
      sepulchres of its ancient audiences, Greek, Roman, and
      Oriental&mdash;tombs which had become already an object of
      speculation, and been rifled for arms, vases, or gold rings,
      before Great Britain had made the first steps beyond painted
      barbarism!</p>

      <p>The eruptions of Etna have all been recorded. Thucydides
      mentions one of them episodically in the Peloponesian war. From
      the cooled caldron that simmers under all that snow, has
      proceeded all the lava that the ancients worked into these their
      city walls. The houses of Taurominium were built of and upon
      <i>lava</i>, which it requires a thousand years to disintegrate.
      After dinner we walk to Naxos, saluting the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg033" id="pg033">033</a></span>statue of the
      patron of a London parish, <i>St Pancras</i>, on our way. He
      stands on the beach here, and claims, by inscription on his
      pedestal, to have belonged to the apostolic times, St Peter
      himself having, he says, appointed him to his bishopric. He is
      patron of Taormina, where he has possessed himself of a Greek
      temple; and he also protects the faithful of Giardini. Lucky in
      his <i>architects</i> has been St Pancras; for many of our
      readers are familiar with his very elegant modern church in the
      New Road, modelled, if we have not forgotten, on the Erechtheum,
      with its <i>Pandrosean Vestries</i>, its upright tiles, and all
      the subordinate details of Athenian architecture. We <i>met</i>
      here the subject of many an ancient <i>bas relief</i> done into
      flesh and blood&mdash;a dozen men and boys tripping along the
      road to the music of a bagpipe, one old <i>Silenus</i> leading
      the jocund throng, and the whole of them, as the music, such as
      it was, inspired, leaping about and gesticulating with incredible
      activity. It was a bacchanalian subject, which we had seen on
      many a sarcophagus, only that the fellows here were not
      <i>quite</i> naked, and that we looked in vain for those nascent
      horns and tails by which the children of Pan and Faunus ought to
      be identified. We always look out for <i>natural history</i>.
      Walking in a narrow street, we saw a tortoise, awake for the
      season, come crawling out to peep at the poultry; his hybernation
      being over, he wants to be social, and the hens in astonishment
      chuckle round him, and his tortoiseshell highness seems pleased
      at their kind enquiries, and keeps bobbing his head in and out of
      his <i>testudo</i> in a very sentimental manner. Women who want
      his shell for <i>combs</i> do not frequent these parts, and so,
      unless a cart pass over him as he returns home, he is in
      clover.</p>

      <p>A bird frequents these parts with a blue chest, called
      <i>Passer solitarius;</i> he abounds in the rocky crevices. The
      notes of one, which was shown to us in a cage, sounded sweetly;
      but, as he was carnivorous, the weather was too hot for us to
      think of taking him away. We saw two snakes put into the same
      box: the one, a viper, presently killed the other, and much the
      larger of the two. Serpents, then, like men, do <i>not</i>, as
      the <i>Satirist</i> asserts, spare their kind. We are
      disappointed at not finding any coins, nor any other good
      <i>souvenirs</i>, to bring away with us. The height of Taormina
      is sufficient to keep it from fever, which is very prevalent at
      Giardini below. Its bay was once a great place for catching
      <i>mullet</i> for the Roman market. It seems to have been the
      <i>Torbay</i> of Sicily. Some fish love their ease, and rejoice
      not in turbulent waters. The <i>muræna</i>, or lamprey, on the
      contrary, was sought in the very whirlpools of <i>Charybdis</i>.
      The modern Roman, on his own side of Italy, has few turbot, but
      very good ones are still taken off Ancona, in the Adriatic, where
      the <i>spatium admirabile Rhombi</i>, as the reader will, or
      ought to recollect, was taken and sent to Domitian at Albano by
      <i>Procaccio</i> or <i>Estafetta</i>. Juvenal complains that the
      Tyrrhene sea was exhausted by the demand for fish, though there
      was no <i>Lent</i> in those times. If the Catholic clergy insist
      that there <i>was</i>, we beg to object, that the keepers thereof
      were probably not in a condition to compete with the
      <i>Apiciuses</i> of the day, who bought fish for their
      <i>bodies'</i>, and not for their SOULS' SAKE.</p>

      <h3>CATANIA.</h3>

      <p>Tum Catane nimium ardenti vicina Typhæo.</p>

      <p>After a pleasant drive of twenty miles, we find ourselves at
      <i>Aci-Reale</i>, where a street, called "Galatea," reminds us
      unexpectedly of a very classical place called Dean's Yard, where
      we once had doings with <i>Acis</i>, as he figures in Ovid's
      <i>Metamorphoses</i>. We were here in luck, and, having purchased
      some fine coins of several of the tyrants of Sicily from the
      apothecary, proceeded on our way to Catania. In half an hour we
      reach the basaltic Isles of the Cyclops, and the Castle of Acis,
      whom the peasants hereabouts tell you was their king, when Sicily
      was under the Saracenic yoke. The <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg034" id="pg034">034</a></span>river <i>Lecatia</i>, now lost,
      is supposed formerly to have issued hereabouts, in the port of
      Ulysses. Our next move placed us amidst the silk-slops of
      Catania. We have hardly been five minutes in the town, when
      offers abound to conduct us up Ætna, in whom, as so much national
      wealth, the inhabitants seem to take as much interest as in her
      useful and productive silk-looms. Standing fearless on the
      pavement of lava that buried their ancient city, they point up
      with complacency to its fountains above. The mischievous exploits
      of Ætna, in past times, are in every mouth, and children learn
      their Ætnean catechism as soon as they are breeched. Ætna here is
      all in all. Churches are constructed out of his quarried
      <i>viscera</i>&mdash;great men lie in tombs, of which the stones
      once ran liquid down his flames&mdash;snuff is taken out of lava
      boxes&mdash;and devotion carves the crucifix on lava, and numbers
      its beads on a lava rosary&mdash;nay, the apothecary's mortar was
      sent him down from the great mortar-battery above, and the
      village <i>belle</i> wears fire-proof bracelets that were once
      too hot to be meddled with. Go to the museum, and you will call
      it a museum of Ætnean products. Nodulated, porous, condensed,
      streaked, spotted, clouded, granulated lava, here assumes the
      colour, rivals the compactness, sustains the polish, of jasper,
      of agate, and of marble; indeed it sometimes surpasses, in
      beautiful veinage, the finest and rarest Marmorean specimens. You
      would hardly distinguish some of it, worked into jazza or vase,
      from <i>rosso antico</i> itself. A very old and rusty armoury
      may, as here, be seen any where; but a row of formidable shark
      skulls, taken along the coast, and some in the very port of
      Catania, are rarities on which the <i>ciceroni</i> like to
      prelect, being furnished with many a story of bathers curtailed
      by them, and secure a large portion of attention, especially if
      you were just thinking of a dip. A rather fine collection of
      bronzes has been made from excavations in the neighbourhood,
      which, indeed, must always promise to reward research. A figure
      of Mercury, two and a half feet high, and so exactly similar to
      that of John of Bologna, that his one seemed an absolute
      plagiarism, particularly attracted our attention on that account.
      The great Italian artist, however, had been dead one hundred and
      fifty years before this bronze was dug up. Next in importance to
      the bronzes, we esteem the collection of Sicilian, or
      Græco-Sicilian vases, though inferior in number and selectness to
      those of the Vatican, or Museo-Borbonico. There is also some
      ancient sculpture, and some pretty mosaic. Of this composition is
      a bathfloor, where a family of Cupids, in the centre of the
      pavement, welcome you with a <i>utere feliciter</i>, (may it do
      you good.) Round the border, a circle of the personified
      <i>"months"</i> is artistically chained together, each bearing
      his <i>Greek</i> name, for fear of a mistake&mdash;names not half
      so good as Sheridan's translation of the Revolutionary
      calendar&mdash;snowy, flowy, blowy&mdash;showery, flowery,
      bowery&mdash;moppy, croppy, poppy&mdash;breezy, sneezy, freezy.
      In Catania, we find no lack of coins, nor of sharp-eyed dealers,
      who know pretty generally their value throughout Europe; but, in
      order to be quite sure of the price <i>current,</i> ask double
      what they take from one another, and judge, by your abatement of
      it, of the state of the market elsewhere. Now mind, sir, when
      they present you the most impudent forgeries, you are not to get
      into a passion; but, glancing from the object to the vender,
      quietly insinuate your want of <i>absolute</i> conviction in a
      <i>"che vi pare di questa moneta."</i> He now looks at it again,
      and takes a squint at <i>you;</i> and supposing you smell a rat,
      probably replies that certainly he <i>bought</i> it for
      <i>genuine;</i> but you <i>have suggested a doubt,</i> and the
      piece really begins, even to <i>him</i>, to look suspicious,
      <i>"anzi à me."</i> You reply coolly, and put it down&mdash;"That
      was just what I was thinking;" and so the affair passes quietly
      off. And now you <i>may</i>, if you happen to be tender-hearted,
      say something compassionate to the poor innocent who has been
      <i>taken in</i>, and proceed to ask him about another; and when
      you see any thing you long to pocket, enquire what can he afford
      to let a <i>brother collector</i> (give him a step in rank) have
      <i>it</i> for; and so go on feeling your way, and never "putting
      your arm so far out that you cannot comfortably draw it back
      again." He will probably ask you if you know Mr B&mdash;&mdash;
      or C&mdash;&mdash;, (English <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg035" id="pg035">035</a></span>collectors,) with whom he has
      had dealings, calling them "<i>stimabili signori;</i>" and, of
      course, you have no doubt of it, though you never heard of them
      before. It is also always conciliative to congratulate him on the
      possession of such and such rare and "<i>belle cose;</i>" and if
      you thus contrive to get into his good graces, he will deal with
      you at <i>fair prices</i>, and perhaps amuse you with an account
      of such tricks as he is not ashamed to have practised on
      <i>blockheads</i>, who will buy at any cost if the die is fine.
      Indeed, it has passed into an aphorism among these
      <i>mezzo-galantuomini</i>, as their countrymen call them, that a
      fine coin is always worth <i>what you can get for it.</i></p>

      <p>We heard the celebrated organ of St Benedict, which has been
      praising God in tremendous hallelujahs ever since it was put up,
      and a hundred years have only matured the richness of its tones.
      Its voice was gushing out as we entered the church, and filling
      nave and aisle with a diapason of all that was soft and soothing,
      as if a choir of Guido's angels had broke out in harmony.</p>

      <p>A stream of fresh water issues under the old town-wall, and an
      immense mass of incumbent lava, of at least ninety feet high,
      impends just above its source, the water struggling through a
      mass of rock once liquefied by fire, in as limpid a rill as if it
      came from limestone, and so excellent in quality that no other is
      used in Catania. Women with buckets were ascending and descending
      to fetch supplies out of the lava of the dead city below, for the
      use of the living town above. Moreover, this is the only point in
      Catania where the accident of a bit of wall arresting for some
      time the progress of the lava current, has left the level of the
      old town to be rigidly ascertained.</p>

      <p>Here, as at <i>Aci-Reale</i>, balconies at windows, for the
      most part supported by brackets, terminating in human heads, give
      a rich, though rather a heavy, appearance to the street. Much
      amber is found and worked at Catania. It has been lately
      discovered in a fossil state, and in contiguity with fossil wood;
      but we were quite <i>electrified</i> at the price of certain
      little scent-bottles, and other articles made of this production.
      You see it in all its possible varieties of colour, opacity, or
      transparency. The green opalized kind is the most prized, and
      four pounds was demanded for a pair of pendants of this colour
      for earrings. Besides the yellow sort, which is common every
      where, we see the ruby red, which is very rare: some varieties
      are freckled, and some of the sort which afforded subjects for
      Martial, and for more than one of the Greek anthologists, with
      insects in its matrix. <i>This</i> kind, they say, is found
      exclusively on the coast of Catania. There are such pieces the
      size of a hand, but it is generally in much smaller bits. Amber
      lies under, or is formed <i>upon</i> the sand, and abounds most
      near the <i>embouchure</i> of a small river in this
      neighbourhood. Many beautiful shells, fossils, and other objects
      of natural history, appear in the dealers' trays; and polished
      knife-handles of Sicilian <i>agate</i> may be had at five dollars
      a dozen. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg036" id=

      <h2>THE LAST OF THE KNIGHTS.</h2>

      <h3>DON JOHN AND THE HERETICS OF FLANDERS.</h3>

      <p>It would almost seem as though chivalry were one of the errors
      of Popery; so completely did the spirit of the ancient orders of
      knighthood evaporate at the Reformation! The blind enthusiasm of
      ignorance having engendered superstitions of every kind and
      colour, the blow struck at the altar of the master idol proved
      fatal to all.</p>

      <p>In Elizabeth's time, the forms and sentiment of chivalry were
      kept up by an effort. The parts enacted by Sidney and Raleigh,
      appear studied rather than instinctive. At all events, the
      gallant Sir Philip was the last of English knights, as he was the
      first of his time. Thenceforward, the valour of the country
      assumed a character more professional.</p>

      <p>But a fact thus familiar to us of England, is more remarkable
      of the rest of Europe. The infallibility of Rome once assailed,
      every faith was shaken. Loyalty was lessened, chivalry became
      extinct; expiring in France with Henri IV. and the
      League&mdash;in Portugal with Don Sebastian of Braganza&mdash;and
      in Spain with Charles V., exterminated root and branch by the pen
      of Cervantes.</p>

      <p>One of the most brilliant effervescences, however, of those
      crumbling institutions, is connected with Spanish history, in the
      person of Don John of Austria;&mdash;a prince who, if consecrated
      by legitimacy to the annals of the throne, would have glorified
      the historical page by a thousand heroic incidents. But the
      sacrament of his baptism being unhappily unpreceded by that of a
      marriage, he has bequeathed us one of those anomalous
      existences&mdash;one of those incomplete destinies, which
      embitter our admiration with disappointment and regret.</p>

      <p>On both sides of royal blood, Don John was born with
      qualifications to adorn a throne. It is true that when his infant
      son was entrusted by Charles V. to the charge of the master of
      his household, Don Quexada, the emperor simply described him as
      the offspring of a lady of Ratisbon, named Barbara Blomberg. But
      the Infanta Clara Eugenia was confidentially informed by her
      father Philip II., and confidentially informed her satellite La
      Cuea, that her uncle was "every way of imperial lineage;" and but
      that he was the offspring of a crime, Don John had doubtless been
      seated on one of those thrones to which his legitimate brother
      Philip imparted so little distinction.</p>

      <p>Forced by the will of Charles V. to recognize the
      consanguinity of Don John, and treat him with brotherly regard,
      one of the objects of the hateful life of the father of Don
      Carlos seems to have been to thwart the ambitious instincts of
      his brilliant Faulconbridge. For in the boiling veins of the
      young prince abided the whole soul of Charles V.,&mdash;valour,
      restlessness, ambition; and his romantic life and mysterious
      death bear alike the tincture of his parentage.</p>

      <p>That was indeed the age of the romance of royalty! Mary at
      Holyrood,&mdash;Elizabeth at Kenilworth&mdash;Carlos at the feet
      of his mother-in-law,&mdash;the Béarnais at the gates of
      Paris,&mdash;have engraved their type in the book of universal
      memory. But Don John escapes notice&mdash;a solitary star
      outshone by dazzling constellations. Commemorated by no medals,
      flattered by no historiographer, sung by no inspired "godson,"
      anointed by neither pope nor primate, his nook in the temple of
      fame is out of sight, and forgotten.</p>

      <p>Even his master feat, the gaining of the battle of Lepanto,
      brings chiefly to our recollection that the author of Don Quixote
      lost his hand in the action; and in the trivial page before us,
      we dare not call our hero by the name of "Don Juan," (by which he
      is known in Spanish history,) lest he be mistaken for the popular
      libertine! And thus, the last of the knights has been stripped of
      his name by the hero of the "Festin de Pierre," and of his
      honours by Cervantes, as by Philip II. of a throne.&mdash;</p>

      <p>Hard fate for one described by all <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg037" id="pg037">037</a></span>the writers of
      his time as a model of manly grace and Christian virtue! How
      charming is the account given by the old Spanish writers of the
      noble youth, extricated from his convent to be introduced on the
      high-road to a princely cavalier, surrounded by his retinue, whom
      he is first desired to salute as a brother, and then required to
      worship, as the king of Spain! We are told of his joy on
      discovering his filial relationship to the great emperor, so long
      the object of his admiration. We are told of his deeds of prowess
      against the Turks at Lepanto, at Tunis against the Moor. We are
      told of the proposition of Gregory XIII. that he should be
      rewarded with the crown of Barbary, and of the desire of the
      revolted nobility of Belgium, to raise him to their tottering
      throne; nay, we are even assured that "la couronne d'Hibernie"
      was offered to his acceptance. And finally, we are told of his
      untimely death and glorious funeral&mdash;mourned by all the
      knighthood of the land! But we hear and forget. Some mysterious
      counter-charm has stripped his laurels of their verdure. Even the
      lesser incidents of the life of Don John are replete with the
      interest of romance. When appointed by Philip II. governor of the
      Netherlands, in order that he might deal with the heretics of the
      Christian faith as with the faithful of Mahomet, such deadly
      vengeance was vowed against his person by the Protestant party
      headed by Horn and the Prince of Orange, that it was judged
      necessary for his highness to perform his journey in disguise.
      Attired as a Moorish slave, he reached Luxembourg as the
      attendant of Ottavio Gonzaga, brother of Prince Amalfi, at the
      very moment the troops of the king of Spain were butchering eight
      thousand citizens in his revolted city of Antwerp!&mdash;</p>

      <p>The arrival of the new governor afforded the signal for more
      pacific measures. The dispositions of Don John were
      humane&mdash;his manners frank. Aware that the Belgian provinces
      were exhausted by ten years of civil war, and that the pay of the
      Spanish troops he had to lead against them was so miserably in
      arrear as to compel them to acts of atrocious spoliation, the
      hero of Lepanto appears to have done his best to stop the
      effusion of blood; and, notwithstanding the counteraction of the
      Prince of Orange, the following spring, peace and an amnesty were
      proclaimed. The treaty signed at Marche, (known by the name of
      the Perpetual Edict,) promised as much tranquillity as was
      compatible with the indignation of a country which had seen the
      blood of its best and noblest poured forth, and the lives and
      property of its citizens sacrificed without mercy or
      calculation.</p>

      <p>But, though welcomed to Brussels by the acclamations of the
      people and the submission of the States, Don John appears to have
      been fully sensible that his head was within the jaws of the
      lion. The blood of Egmont had not yet sunk into the earth; the
      echoes of the edicts of Alva yet lingered in the air; and the
      very stones of Brussels appeared to rise up and testify against a
      brother of Philip II.!</p>

      <p>Right thankful, therefore, was the young prince when an excuse
      was afforded for establishing himself in a more tenable position,
      by an incident which must again be accounted among the romantic
      adventures of his life. For the sudden journey of the fascinating
      Margaret of Valois to the springs of Spa, on pretence of
      indisposition, was generally attributed to a design against the
      heart of the hero of Lepanto.</p>

      <p>A prince so remarkable for his gallantry of knighthood, could
      do no less than wait upon the sister of the French king, on her
      passage through Namur; and, once established in the citadel of
      that stronghold of the royalists, he quitted it no more. In
      process of time, a camp was formed in the environs, and
      fortresses erected on the banks of the Meuse under the inspection
      of Don John; nor was it at first easy to determine whether his
      measures were actuated by mistrust of the Protestants, or
      devotion to the worst and most Catholic of wives of the best and
      most Huguenot of kings.</p>

      <p>The blame of posterity, enlightened by the journal of Queen
      Margaret's proceedings in Belgium, (bequeathed for our
      edification by the alienated queen of Henri IV.,) has accused Don
      John of blindness, in the right-loyal reception bestowed on her,
      and the absolute liberty accorded her during <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg038" id="pg038">038</a></span>her residence
      at Spa, where she was opening a road for the arrival of her
      brother the Duke of Alençon. It is admitted, indeed, that her
      attack upon his heart met with defeat. But the young governor is
      said to have made up in chivalrous courtesies for the
      disappointment of her tender projects; and Margaret, if she did
      not find a lover at Namur, found the most assiduous of
      knights.</p>

      <p>Many, indeed, believe that his attentions to the French
      princess were as much a feint as her own illness; and that he was
      as completely absorbed in keeping at bay his heretic subjects, as
      her highness by the desire of converting them into the subjects
      of France. It was only those admitted into the confidence of Don
      John who possessed the clue to the mystery.</p>

      <p>Ottavio Gonzaga, on his return from a mission to Madrid with
      which he had been charged by Don John, was the first to acquaint
      him with the suspicions to which the sojourn of Margaret had
      given rise.</p>

      <p>"I own I expected to find your highness in better cheer," said
      he, when the first compliments had been exchanged. "Such marvels
      have been recounted in Spain of your fêtes and jousts of honour,
      that I had prepared myself to hear of nothing at headquarters but
      the silken pastimes of a court."</p>

      <p>"Instead of which," cried Don John, "you find me, as usual, in
      my steel jerkin, with no milder music at command than the
      trumpets of my camp; my sole duty, the strengthening of yonder
      lines," continued he, (pointing from a window of the citadel,
      near which they were standing, commanding the confluence of the
      Sambre and Meuse,) "and my utmost diversion, an occasional charge
      against the boars in yonder forest of Marlagne!"</p>

      <p>"I cannot but suppose it more than <i>occasional</i>,"
      rejoined Gonzaga; "for I must pay your highness the ill
      compliment of avowing, that you appear more worn by fatigue and
      weather at this moment, and in this sunless clime, than at the
      height of your glorious labours in the Mediterranean! Namur has
      already ploughed more wrinkles on your brow than Barbary or
      Lepanto."</p>

      <p>"Say rather in my <i>heart</i>!" cried the impetuous prince.
      "Since you quitted me, six months ago, my dear Gonzaga, I have
      known nothing but cares! To you I have no scruple in avowing,
      that my position in this country is hateful. So long accustomed
      to war against a barbarous enemy, I could almost fancy myself as
      much a Moor at heart, as I appeared in visage, when in your
      service on my way to Luxembourg, whenever I find my sword
      uplifted against a Christian breast!&mdash;Civil war, Ottavio, is
      a hideous and repugnant thing!"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"The report is true, then, that your highness has become
      warmly attached to the people of these rebel provinces?" demanded
      Gonzaga, not choosing to declare the rumour prevalent in Spain,
      that an opportunity had been afforded to the prince by the
      Barlaimont faction, of converting his viceroyalty into the sway
      of absolute sovereignty.</p>

      <p>"So much the reverse, that the evil impression they made on me
      at my arrival, has increased a hundred-fold! I abhor them yet
      more and more. Flemings or Brabançons, Hainaulters or Walloons,
      Catholic or Calvinist, the whole tribe is my aversion; and
      despite our best endeavours to conceal it, I am convinced the
      feeling is reciprocal!"</p>

      <p>"If your highness was equally candid in your avowals to the
      Queen of Navarre," observed Gonzaga gravely,&mdash;"I can
      scarcely wonder at the hopes she is said to entertain of having
      won over the governor of Mons to the French interest, during her
      transit through Flanders."</p>

      <p>"Ay, indeed? Is such her boast?" cried the prince, laughing.
      "It may indeed be so!&mdash;for never saw I a woman less
      scrupulous in the choice or use of arms to fight her battles.
      But, trust me, whatever her majesty may have accomplished, is
      through no aiding or abetting of mine."</p>

      <p>"Yet surely the devoted attentions paid her by your
      highness"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"My highness made them <i>appear</i> devoted in proportion to
      his consciousness of their hollowness! But I promise you, my dear
      Ottavio, there is no tenderer leaning in my heart towards
      Margaret de Valois, than towards the most thicklipped of the
      divinities who competed for our smiles at Tunis." <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg039" id="pg039">039</a></span> Gonzaga
      shrugged his shoulders. He was convinced that, for once, Don John
      was sinking the friend in the prince. His prolonged absence had
      perhaps discharged him from his post as confidant.</p>

      <p>"Trust me," cried the young soldier, discerning his
      misgivings&mdash;"I am as sincere in all this as becomes our
      friendship. But that God has gifted me with a happy temperament,
      I should scarcely support the disgusts of my present calling. It
      is much, my dear Gonzaga, to inherit as a birthright the brand of
      such an ignominy as mine. But as long as I trusted to conquer a
      happier destiny&mdash;to carve out for myself fortunes as
      glorious as those to which my blood all but entitles me&mdash;I
      bore my cross without repining. It was this ardent hope of
      distinction that lent vigour to my arm in battle&mdash;that
      taught prudence to my mind in council. I was resolved that even
      the base-born of Charles V. should die a king!"&mdash;</p>

      <p>Gonzaga listened in startled silence. To hear the young
      viceroy thus bold in the avowal of sentiments, which of late he
      had been hearing imputed to him at the Escurial as the direst of
      crimes, filled him with amazement.</p>

      <p>"But these hopes have expired!" resumed Don John. "The
      harshness with which, on my return triumphant from Barbary, my
      brother refused to ratify the propositions of the Vatican in my
      favour, convinced me that I have nothing to expect from Philip
      beyond the perpetual servitude of a satellite of the King of
      Spain."</p>

      <p>Gonzaga glanced mechanically round the chamber at the emission
      of these treasonable words. But there was nothing in its rude
      stone walls to harbour an eavesdropper.</p>

      <p>"Nor is this all!" cried his noble friend. "My discovery of
      the unbrotherly sentiments of Philip has tended to enlighten me
      towards the hatefulness of his policy. The reserve of his
      nature&mdash;the harshness of his soul&mdash;the austerity of his
      bigotry&mdash;chill me to the marrow!&mdash;The Holy Inquisition
      deserves, in my estimation, a name the very antithesis of
      holy."</p>

      <p>"I <i>beseech</i> your highness!" cried Ottavio
      Gonzaga&mdash;clasping his hands together in an irrepressible
      panic.</p>

      <p>"Never fear, man! There be neither spies nor inquisitors in
      our camp; and if there <i>were</i>, both they and you must even
      hear me out!" cried Don John. "There is some comfort in
      discharging one's heart of matters that have long lain so heavy
      on it; and I swear to you, Gonzaga, that, instead of feeling
      surprised to find my cheeks so lank, and my eyes so hollow, you
      would rather be amazed to find an ounce of flesh upon my bones,
      did you know how careful are my days, and how sleepless my
      nights, under the perpetual harassments of civil war!&mdash;The
      haughty burgesses of Ghent, whom I could hate from my soul but
      that they are townsmen of my illustrious father, the low-minded
      Walloons, the morose Brugeois, the artful Brabançons&mdash;all
      the varied tribes, in short, of the old Burgundian duchy, seem to
      vie with each other which shall succeed best in thwarting and
      humiliating me. And for what do I bear it? What honour or profit
      shall I reap on my patience? What thanks derive for having wasted
      my best days and best energies, in bruising with my iron heel the
      head of the serpent of heresy? Why, even that Philip, for some
      toy of a mass neglected or an ave forgotten, will perchance give
      me over to the tender questioning of his grand inquisitor, as the
      shortest possible answer to my pretensions to a
      crown,&mdash;while the arrogant nobility of Spain, when roused
      from their apathy towards me by tidings of another Lepanto, a
      fresh Tunis, will exclaim with modified
      gratification&mdash;'<i>There</i> spoke the blood of Charles the
      Fifth! Not so ill fought for a bastard!'"</p>

      <p>Perceiving that the feelings of his highness were chafed, the
      courtier, as in vocation bound, assured him he underrated the
      loyalty towards him of his fellow countrymen of the Peninsula;
      and that his services as governor of the Low Countries were fully
      appreciated.</p>

      <p>"So fully, that I should be little surprised to learn the axe
      was already sharpened that is to take off my head!" cried Don
      John, with a scornful laugh. "And such being the exact state of
      my feelings and opinions, my trusty Gonzaga, I ask you whether I
      am likely to have proved a suitable Petrarch for so accomplished
      a Laura as the sister of Henry III?"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"I confess myself disappointed," <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg040" id="pg040">040</a></span>replied the
      crafty Italian.&mdash;"I was in hopes that your highness had
      found recreation as well as glory in Belgium. During my sojourn
      at the court of Philip, I supported with patience the somewhat
      ceremonious gravity of the Escurial, in the belief that your
      highness was enjoying meanwhile those festal enlivenments, which
      none more fully understand how to organize and adorn."</p>

      <p>"If such an expectation really availed to <i>enliven</i> the
      Escurial," cried Don John recklessly, "your friendship must
      indeed possess miraculous properties! However, you may judge with
      your own eyes the pleasantness of my position; and every day that
      improves your acquaintance with the ill blood and ill condition
      of this accursed army of the royalists, ill-paid,
      ill-disciplined, and ill-intentioned, will inspire you with
      stronger yearnings after our days of the Mediterranean, where I
      was master of myself and of my men."</p>

      <p>"And all this was manifested to Margaret, and all this will
      serve to comfort the venomous heart of the queen
      mother!"&mdash;ejaculated Gonzaga, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

      <p>"Not a syllable, not a circumstance! The Queen of Navarre was
      far too much engrossed by the manoeuvres of her own bright eyes,
      to take heed of those of my camp."</p>

      <p>"Your highness is perhaps less well aware than might be
      desirable, of how many things a woman's eyes are capable of
      doing, at one and the same time!"&mdash;retorted the Italian.</p>

      <p>"I only wish," cried Don John impatiently, "that instead of
      having occasion to read me those Jeremiads, you had been here to
      witness the friendship you so strangely exaggerate! A ball, an
      excursion on the Meuse, a boar hunt in the forest of Marlagne,
      constitute the pastimes you are pleased to magnify into an
      imperial ovation."</p>

      <p>"Much may be confided amid the splendour of a
      ball-room,&mdash;much in one poor half hour of a greenwood
      rendezvous!"&mdash;persisted the provoking Ottavio.</p>

      <p>"Ay&mdash;<i>much</i> indeed!" responded Don John, with a sigh
      so deep that it startled by its significance the attention of his
      brother in arms. "But not to such a woman as the Queen of Henri
      the Béarnais!" returned the Prince. "By our Lady of Liesse! I
      wish no worse to that heretic prince, than to have placed his
      honour in the keeping of the <i>gente Margot</i>."</p>

      <p>Fain would Gonzaga have pursued the conversation, which had
      taken a turn that promised wonders for the interest of the
      despatches he had undertaken to forward to the Escurial, in
      elucidation of the designs and sentiments of Don
      John,&mdash;towards whom his allegiance was as the kisses of
      Judas! But the imperial scion, (who, when he pleased, could
      assume the unapproachability of the blood royal,) made it
      apparent that he was no longer in a mood to be questioned. Having
      proposed to the new-comer (to whom, as an experienced commander,
      he destined the colonelship of his cavalry,) that they should
      proceed to a survey of the fortifications at Bouge, they mounted
      their horses, and, escorted by Nignio di Zuniga, the Spanish
      aide-de-camp of the prince, proceeded to the camp.</p>

      <p>The affectionate deference testified towards the young
      governor by all classes, the moment he made his appearance in
      public, appeared to Gonzaga strangely in contradiction with the
      declarations of Don John that he was no favourite in Belgium. The
      Italian forgot that the Duke of Arschot, the Counts of Mansfeld
      and Barlaimont, while doffing their caps to the representative of
      the King of Spain, had as much right to behold in him the devoted
      friend of Don John of Austria, as <i>he</i> to regard <i>them</i>
      as the faithful vassals of his government.</p>

      <p>A fair country is the country of Namur!&mdash;The confluent
      streams&mdash;the impending rocks&mdash;the spreading forests of
      its environs, comprehend the finest features of landscape; nor
      could Ottavio Gonzaga feel surprised that his prince should find
      as much more pleasure in those breesy plains than in the narrow
      streets of Brussels, as he found security and strength.</p>

      <p>On the rocks overhanging the Meuse, at some distance from the
      town, stands the village of Bouge, fortified by Don John; to
      attain which by land, hamlets and thickets were to be traversed;
      and it was pleasant <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg041" id=
      "pg041">041</a></span>to see the Walloon peasant children run
      forth from the cottages to salute the royal train, making their
      heavy Flemish chargers swerve aside and perform their lumbering
      cabrioles far more deftly than the cannonading of the rebels, to
      which they were almost accustomed.</p>

      <p>As they cut across a meadow formed by the windings of the
      Meuse, they saw at a distance a group formed, like most groups
      congregated just then in the district, of soldiers and peasants;
      to which the attention of the prince being directed, Nignio di
      Zuniga, his aide-de-camp, was dispatched to ascertain the cause
      of the gathering.</p>

      <p>"A nothing, if it please your highness!" was the reply of the
      Spaniard&mdash;galloping back, hat in hand, with its plumes
      streaming in the breeze;&mdash;that the Prince's train, which had
      halted, might resume its pace.</p>

      <p>"But a nothing of what sort?" persisted Don John, who
      appreciated the trivialties of life very differently from those
      by whom he was surrounded.</p>

      <p>"A village grievance!&mdash;An old woman roaring her lungs out
      for a cow which has been carried off by our
      troopers!"&mdash;grumbled the aide-de-camp, with less respect
      than was usual to him.</p>

      <p>"And call you that a <i>nothing</i>?"&mdash;exclaimed his
      master. "By our lady of Liesse, it is an act of cruelty and
      oppression&mdash;a thing calculated to make us hateful in the
      eyes of the village!&mdash;And many villages, my good Nignio,
      represent districts, and many districts provinces, and provinces
      a country; and by an accumulation of such resentments as the
      indignation of this old crone, will the King of Spain and the
      Catholic faith be driven out of Flanders!&mdash;See to it! I want
      no further attendance of you this morning! Let the cow be
      restored before sunset, and the marauders punished."</p>

      <p>"But if, as will likely prove the case, the beast is no longer
      in its skin?"&mdash;demanded the aide-de-camp. "If the cow should
      have been already eaten, in a score of messes of pottage?"</p>

      <p>"Let her have compensation."</p>

      <p>"The money chest at headquarters, if it please your highness,
      is all but empty," replied Nignio, glancing with a smile towards
      Gonzaga,&mdash;as though they were accustomed to jest together
      over the reckless openness of heart and hand of their young
      chief.</p>

      <p>"Then, by the blessed shrine of St Jago, give the fellows at
      least the strappado," cried Don John, out of all patience. "Since
      restitution may not be, be the retribution all the heavier."</p>

      <p>"It is ever thus," cried he, addressing himself to Gonzaga, as
      the aide-de-camp resumed his plumed beaver, and galloped off with
      an imprecation between his lips, at having so rustic a duty on
      his hands, instead of accompanying the parade of his royal
      master. "It goes against my conscience to decree the chastisement
      of these fellows. For i' faith, they that fight, must feed; and
      hunger, that eats through stone walls, is apt to have a nibble at
      honesty. My royal brother, or those who have the distribution of
      his graces, is so much more liberal of edicts and anathemas than
      of orders on the treasury of Spain, that money and rations are
      evermore wanting. If these Protestants persist in their stand
      against us, I shall have to go forth to all the Catholic cities
      of the empire, preaching, like Peter the hermit, to obtain
      contributions from the pious!"</p>

      <p>"His Majesty is perhaps of opinion," observed Gonzaga, "that
      rebels and heretics ought to supply the maintenance of the troops
      sent to reduce them to submission."</p>

      <p>"A curious mode of engaging their affections towards either
      the creed or prince from which they have revolted!" cried Don
      John. "But you say true, Ottavio. Such are precisely the
      instructions of my royal brother; whom the Almighty soften with a
      more Christian spirit in his upholding of the doctrines of
      Christianity!&mdash;I am bidden to regard myself as in a
      conquered country. I am bidden to feel myself as I may have felt
      at Modon or Lepanto. It may not be, it may not be!&mdash;These
      people were the loyal subjects of my forefathers. These people
      are the faithful followers of Christ."</p>

      <p>"Let us trust that the old woman may get back her cow, and
      your highness's tender conscience stand absolved,"&mdash;observed
      Gonzaga with a smile of ill-repressed derision. "I <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg042" id="pg042">042</a></span>fear, indeed,
      that the Court of the Escurial is unprepared with sympathy for
      such grievances."</p>

      <p>"Gonzaga!"&mdash;exclaimed Don John, suddenly reining up his
      horse, and looking his companion full in the face, "these are
      black and bitter times; and apt to make kings, princes, nobles,
      ay, and even prelates, forget that they are men; or rather that
      there be men in the world beside themselves."&mdash;Then allowing
      his charger to resume its caracolling, to give time to his
      startled friend to recover from the glow of consciousness burning
      on his cheek,&mdash;he resumed with a less stern inflexion. "It
      is the vexation of this conviction that hath brought my face to
      the meagreness and sallow tint that accused the scorching sun of
      Barbary. I love the rush of battle. The clash of swords or
      roaring of artillery is music to me. There is joy in contending,
      life for life, with a traitor, and marshaling the fierce
      battalions on the field. But the battle done, let the sword be
      sheathed! The struggle over, let the blood sink into the earth,
      and the deadly smoke disperse, and give to view once more the
      peace of heaven!&mdash;The petty aggravations of daily
      strife,&mdash;the cold-blooded oppressions of conquest,&mdash;the
      contest with the peasant for his morsel of bread, or with his
      chaste wife for her fidelity,&mdash;are so revolting to my
      conscience of good and evil, that as the Lord liveth there are
      moments when I am tempted to resign for ever the music I love so
      well of drum and trumpet, and betake myself, like my royal
      father, to some drowsy monastery, to listen to the end of my days
      to the snuffling of Capuchins!"</p>

      <p>Scarce could Ottavio Gonzaga, so recently emancipated from the
      Escurial, refrain from making the sign of the cross at this
      heinous declaration!&mdash;But he contained himself.&mdash;It was
      his object to work his way still further into the confidence of
      his royal companion.</p>

      <p>"The chief pleasure I derived from the visit of the French
      princess to Namur," resumed Don John, "was the respite it
      afforded from the contemplation of such miseries and such
      aggressions. I was sick at heart of groans and
      murmurs,&mdash;weary of the adjustment of grievances. To behold a
      woman's face, whereof the eyes were not red with weeping, was
      <i>something</i>!"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"And the eyes of the fair Queen of Navarre are said to be of
      the brightest!" observed Gonzaga with a sneer.</p>

      <p>"As God judgeth my soul, I noted not their hue or brightness!"
      exclaimed Don John. "Her voice was a woman's&mdash;her bearing a
      woman's&mdash;her tastes a woman's. And it brought back the
      memory of better days to hear the silken robes of her train
      rustling around me, instead of the customary clang of mail; and
      merry laughs instead of perpetual moans, or the rude oaths of my
      Walloons!"</p>

      <p>An incredulous smile played on the handsome features of the
      Italian.&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Have out your laugh!" cried Don John. "You had not thought to
      see the lion of Lepanto converted into so mere a
      lap-dog!&mdash;Is it not so?"</p>

      <p>"As little so as I can admit without the disrespect of denial
      to your highness,"&mdash;replied Gonzaga, with a low obeisance.
      "My smile was occasioned by wonder that one so little skilled in
      feigning as the royal lion of Lepanto, should even hazard the
      attempt. There, at least&mdash;and there alone&mdash;is Don John
      of Austria certain of defeat!"</p>

      <p>"I might, perhaps, waste more time in persuading you that the
      air of Flanders hath not taught me lying as well as compassion,"
      replied the Infant; "but that yonder green mound is our first
      redoubt. The lines of Bouge are before you."</p>

      <p>Professional discussion now usurped the place of friendly
      intercourse. On the arrival of the prince, the drums of
      headquarters beat to arms; and a moment afterwards, Don John was
      surrounded by his officers; exhibiting, in the issuing of his
      orders of the day, the able promptitude of one of the first
      commanders of his time, tempered by the dignified courtesy of a
      prince of the blood.</p>

      <p>Even Ottavio Gonzaga was too much engrossed by the tactical
      debates carrying on around him, to have further thought of the
      mysteries into which he was resolved to penetrate.</p>

      <p>It was not till the decline of day, that the prince and his
      <i>état major</i> returned to Namur; invitations having been
      frankly given by Don John to a <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg043" id="pg043">043</a></span>score of his officers, to an
      entertainment in honour of the return of his friend.</p>

      <p>Amid the jovialty of such an entertainment, Gonzaga
      entertained little doubt of learning the truth. The rough
      railleries of such men were not likely to respect so slight a
      circumvallation as the honour of female reputation; and the
      glowing vintage of the Moselle and Rhine would bring forth the
      secret among the bubbles of their flowing tides. And, in truth,
      scarcely were the salvers withdrawn, when the potations of these
      mailed carousers produced deep oaths and uproarious laughter;
      amid which was toasted the name of Margaret, with the enthusiasm
      due to one of the originators of the massacre of St Bartholomew,
      from the most Catholic captains of the founder of the Inquisition
      of Spain.</p>

      <p>The admiration due to her beauty, was, however, couched in
      terms scarcely warranted on the lips of men of honour, even by
      such frailties as Margaret's; and, to the surprise of Gonzaga, no
      restraint was imposed by the presence of her imputed lover. It
      seemed an established thing, that the name of Margaret was a
      matter of indifference in the ears of Don John!</p>

      <p>That very night, therefore, (the banquet being of short
      continuance as there was to be a field-day at daybreak, under the
      reviewal of the prince,) Ottavio Gonzaga, more than ever to seek
      in his conjectures, resolved to address himself for further
      information to Nignio; to whom he had brought confidential
      letters from his family in Spain, and who was an ancient brother
      in arms.</p>

      <p>Having made out without much difficulty, the chamber occupied
      by the Spanish captain, in a tower of the citadel overlooking the
      valley of the Sambre, there was some excuse for preventing his
      early rest with a view to the morrow's exercises, in the plea of
      news from Madrid.</p>

      <p>But as the Italian anticipated, ere he had half disburdened
      his budget of Escurial gossip, Nignio de Zuniga had his own
      grievances to confide. Uppermost in his mind, was the irritation
      of having been employed that morning in a cow-hunt; and from
      execrations on the name of the old woman, enriched with all the
      blasphemies of a trooper's vocabulary,&mdash;it was no difficult
      matter to glide to the general misdemeanours and malefactions of
      the sex. For Gabriel Nignio was a man of iron,&mdash;bred in
      camps, with as little of the milk of human kindness in his nature
      as his royal master King Philip; and it was his devout
      conviction, that no petticoat should be allowed within ten
      leagues of any Christian encampment,&mdash;and that women were
      inflicted upon this nether earth, solely for the abasement and
      contamination of the nobler sex.</p>

      <p>"As if that accursed Frenchwoman, and the nest of jays, her
      maids of honour, were not enough for the penance of an unhappy
      sinner for the space of a calendar year!"&mdash;cried he, still
      harping upon the old woman.</p>

      <p>"The visit of Queen Margaret must indeed have put you to some
      trouble and confusion," observed Gonzaga carelessly. "From as
      much as is <i>apparent</i> of your householding, I can scarce
      imagine how you managed to bestow so courtly a dame here in
      honour; or with what pastimes you managed to entertain her."</p>

      <p>"The sequins of Lepanto and piastres of his holiness were not
      yet quite exhausted," replied Nignio. "Even the Namurrois came
      down handsomely. The sister of two French kings, and
      sister-in-law of the Duke of Lorraine, was a person for even the
      thick-skulled Walloons to respect. It was not <i>money</i> that
      was wanting&mdash;it was patience. O, these Parisians! Make me
      monkey-keeper, blessed Virgin, to the beast garden of the
      Escurial; but spare me for the rest of my days the honour of
      being seneschal to the finikin household of a queen on her
      travels!"</p>

      <p>Impossible to forbear a laugh at the fervent hatred depicted
      in the warworn features of the Castilian captain, "I' faith, my
      clear Nignio," said Gonzaga, "for the squire of so gallant a
      knight as Don John of Austria, your notions are rather those of
      Mahound or Termagaunt! What would his highness say, were he to
      hear you thus bitter against his Dulcinea?"</p>

      <p>"<i>His</i> Dulcinea!"&mdash;ejaculated the aide-de-camp with
      a air of disgust. "God <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg044" id=
      "pg044">044</a></span>grant it! For a princess of Valois blood,
      reared under the teaching of a Medici, had at least the
      recommendations of nobility and orthodoxy in her favour."</p>

      <p>"As was the case when Anna di Mendoça effected the conquest
      over his boyish affections, so generously pardoned by his royal
      brother!&mdash;But after such proof of the hereditary aspirings
      of Don John, it would be difficult to persuade me of his
      highness's derogation."</p>

      <p>"Would <i>I</i> could say as much!"&mdash;exclaimed Nignio,
      with a groan. "But such a cow-hunt as mine of this morning, might
      convince the scepticism of St Thomas!"</p>

      <p>"What, in the name of the whole calendar, have the affections
      of the prince in common with your exploit?" said Gonzaga. "Would
      you have me infer that the son of Charles V. is enamoured of a
      dairy wench?"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Of <i>worse</i>! of a daughter of the
      Amalekites!"&mdash;cried Nignio&mdash;stretching out his widely
      booted legs, as though it were a relief to him to have
      disburthened himself of his mystery.</p>

      <p>"I have not the honour of understanding you," replied the
      Italian,&mdash;no further versed in Scripture history than was
      the pleasure of his almoner.</p>

      <p>"You are his highness's <i>friend</i>, Gonzaga!" resumed the
      Spanish captain. "Even among his countrymen, none so near his
      heart! I have therefore no scruple in acquainting you with a
      matter, wherein, from the first, I determined to seek your
      counteraction. Though seemingly but a straw thrown up into the
      air, I infer from it a most evil predilection on the part of Don
      John;&mdash;fatal to himself, to us, his friends, and to the
      country he represents in Belgium."</p>

      <p>"Nay, now you are serious indeed!" cried his companion,
      delighted to come to the point. "I was in hopes it was some mere
      matter of a pair of rosy lips and a flaunting top-knot!"</p>

      <p>"At the time Queen Margaret visited Namur," began the
      aide-de-camp&mdash;</p>

      <p>"I knew it!" interrupted Gonzaga, "I was as prepared for it as
      for the opening of a fairy legend&mdash;'On a time their lived a
      king and queen'&mdash;"</p>

      <p>"Will <i>you</i> tell the story, then, or shall
      I?"&mdash;cried Nignio, impatient of his interruption.</p>

      <p>"<i>Yourself</i>, my pearl of squires! granting me in the
      first place your pardon for my ill manners."&mdash;</p>

      <p>"When Margaret de Valois visited Namur," resumed Nignio, "the
      best diversions we had to offer to so fair and pious a princess
      were, first a <i>Te Deum</i> in the cathedral for her safe
      journey; next, an entertainment of dancing and music at the town
      hall&mdash;and a gallant affair it was, as far as silver
      draperies, and garlands of roses, and a blaze of light that
      seemed to threaten the conflagration of the city, may be taken in
      praise. The queen had brought with her, as with <i>malice
      prepense</i>, six of the loveliest ladies of honour gracing the
      court of the Louvre"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"I <i>knew</i> it!"&mdash;again interrupted Gonzaga;&mdash;and
      again did Nignio gravely enquire of him whether (since so well
      informed) he would be pleased to finish the history in his own
      way?</p>

      <p>"Your pardon! your pardon!" cried the Italian, laying his
      finger on his lips. "Henceforward I am mute as a carp of the
      Meuse."</p>

      <p>"It afforded, therefore, some mortification to this astutious
      princess,&mdash;this daughter of Herodias, with more than all her
      mother's cunning and cruelty in her soul,&mdash;to perceive that
      the Spanish warriors, who on that occasion beheld for the first
      time the assembled nobility of Brabant and Namur, were more
      struck by the Teutonic charms of these fair-haired daughters of
      the north, (so antipodal to all we are accustomed to see in our
      sunburned provinces,) than by the mannered graces of her
      pleasure-worn Parisian belles."&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Certain it is," observed Gonzaga, (despite his recent
      pledge,) "that there is no greater contrast than between our
      wild-eyed, glowing Andalusians, and the slow-footed, blue-eyed
      daughters of these northern mists, whose smiles are as moonshine
      to sunshine!"</p>

      <p>"After excess of sunshine, people sometimes prefer the calmer
      and milder radiance of the lesser light. And I promise you that,
      at this moment, if there be pillows sleepless yonder in the camp
      for the sake of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg045" id=
      "pg045">045</a></span>the costly fragile toys called womankind,
      those jackasses of lovelorn lads have cause to regret the sojourn
      of Queen Margaret in Belgium, only as having brought forth from
      their castles in the Ardennes or the froggeries of the Low
      Country, the indigenous divinities that I would were at this
      moment at the bottom of their muddy moats, or of the Sambre
      flowing under yonder window!"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"It is one of these Brabançon belles, then, who"&mdash;</p>

      <p>Gabriel Nignio de Zuniga half rose from his chair, as a signal
      for breaking off the communication he was not allowed to pursue
      in his own way.&mdash;Taking counsel of himself, however, he
      judged that the shorter way was to tell his tale in a shorter
      manner, so as to set further molestation at defiance.</p>

      <p>"In one word," resumed he, with a vivacity of utterance
      foreign to his Spanish habits of grandiloquence, "at that ball,
      there appeared among the dancers of the Coranto, exhibited before
      the tent of state of Queen Margaret, a young girl whose tender
      years seemed to render the exhibition almost an indiscretion; and
      whose aerial figure appeared to make her sojourn there, or any
      other spot on earth a matter of wonder. Her dress was simple, her
      fair hair streamed on her shoulders. It was one of the angels of
      your immortal Titian, <i>minus</i> the wings! Such was, at least,
      the description given me by Don John, to enable me to ascertain
      among the Namurrois her name and lineage, for the satisfaction
      (he said) of the queen, whose attention had been fascinated by
      her beauty."</p>

      <p>"And you proceeded, I doubt not, on your errand with all the
      grace and good-will I saw you put into your commission of this
      morning?"&mdash;cried Gonzaga, laughing.</p>

      <p>"And nearly the same result!&mdash;My answer to the enquiry of
      his highness was <i>verbatim</i> the same; that the matter was
      not worth asking after. This white rose of the Meuse was not so
      much as of a chapteral-house. Some piece of provincial obscurity
      that had issued from the shade, to fill a place in the royal
      Coranto, in consequence of the indisposition of one of the noble
      daughters of the house of Croy. Still, as in the matter of the
      cow-hunt, his highness had the malice to persist! And next day,
      instead of allowing me to attend him in his barging with the
      royal Cleopatra of this confounded Cydnus of Brabant, I was
      dispatched into all quarters of Namur to seek out a pretty child
      with silken hair and laughing eyes, whom some silly grandam had
      snatched out of its nursery to parade at a royal fête.&mdash;Holy
      St Laurence! how my soul grilled within my skin!&mdash;I did, as
      you may suppose, as much of his highness's pleasure as squared
      with my own; and had the satisfaction of informing him, on his
      return, that the bird had fled."&mdash;</p>

      <p>"And there was an end of the matter?"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"I hoped so! But I am not precisely the confessor his highness
      is likely to select when love constitutes the sin. At all events,
      the bustle of Margaret's departure for Spa, the care of the royal
      escort, and the payment of all that decency required us to take
      upon ourselves of the cost of our hospitality, engrossed my time
      and thoughts. But the first time the Infant beset me, (as he has
      doubtless done yourself,) with his chapter of lamentations over
      the sufferings of Belgium,&mdash;the lawlessness of the
      camp&mdash;the former loyalty of the provinces&mdash;the
      tenderness of conscience of the heretics,&mdash;and the
      eligibility of forbearance and peace,&mdash;I saw as plain as
      though the word were inscribed by the burning finger of Satan,
      that the turkois eyes and flaxen ringlets were the text of all
      this snivelling humanity!'</p>

      <p>"Blessings on the tender consciences of the heretics, who were
      burning Antwerp and Ghent, and plundering the religious houses
      and putting their priests to the sword!" ejaculated Gonzaga.</p>

      <p>"The exigencies of the hour, however, left little leisure to
      Don John for the nursing of his infant passion; and a few weeks
      past, I entertained hopes that, Queen Margaret being safe back at
      her Louvre, the heart of the Prince was safe back in its place;
      more especially when he one day proposed to me an exploit
      savouring more of his days of Lepanto than I had expected at his
      hands again. Distracted by the false intelligence <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg046" id="pg046">046</a></span>wherewith we
      were perpetually misled by the Brabançon scouts, Don John
      determined on a sortie in disguise, towards the intrenchments of
      the enemy, betwixt the Sambre and Dyle. Rumour of the
      reinforcements of English troops dispatched to the heretics by
      Queen Elizabeth at the instance of the diet of Worms, rendered
      him anxious; and bent upon ascertaining the exact cantonments of
      Colonel Norris and his Scottish companies, we set forward before
      daybreak towards the forest of Marlagne, as for a hunting
      expedition; then exchanging our dresses for the simple suits of
      civilians at the house of the verderer, made our way across the
      Sambre towards Gembloux."</p>

      <p>"A mad project!&mdash;But such were ever the delight of our
      Quixote!"&mdash;cried Gonzaga.</p>

      <p>"In this instance, all prospered. We crossed the country
      without obstacle, mounted on two powerful Mecklenburgers; and
      before noon, were deep in Brabant. The very rashness of the
      undertaking seemed to restore to Don John his forgotten hilarity
      of old! He was like a truant schoolboy, that has cheated his
      pedagogue of a day's bird-nesting; and eyes more discerning than
      those of the stultified natives of these sluggish provinces, had
      been puzzled to detect under the huge patch that blinded him of
      an eye, and the slashed sleeve of his sad-coloured suit that
      showed him wounded of an arm, the gallant host of Queen Margaret!
      'My soul comes back into me with this gallop across the breezy
      plain, unencumbered by the trampling of a guard!' cried the
      Prince. 'There is the making in me yet of another Lepanto! But
      two provinces remain faithful to our standard: his highness of
      Orange and the Archduke having filched, one by one, from their
      allegiance the hearts of these pious Netherlanders; who can no
      better prove their fear of God than by ceasing to honour the king
      he hath been pleased to set over them. Nevertheless, with
      Luxembourg and Namur for our vantage-ground, and under the
      blessing of his holiness, the banner under which I conquered the
      infidel, shall, sooner or later, float victorious under this
      northern sky!'</p>

      <p>"Such was the tenour of his discourse as we entered a wood,
      halfway through which, the itinerary I had consulted informed me
      we had to cross a branch of the Dyle. But on reaching the
      ferry-house of this unfrequented track, we found only two
      sumpter-mules tied to a tree near the hovel, and a boat chained
      to its stump beside the stream. In answer to our shouts, no
      vestige of a ferryman appeared; and behold the boat-chain was
      locked, and the current too deep and strong for fording.</p>

      <p>"Where there is smoke there is fire! No boat without a
      boatman!" cried the Prince; and leaping from his horse, which he
      gave me to hold, and renewing his vociferations, he was about to
      enter the ferry-house, when, just as he reached the wooden porch,
      a young girl, holding her finger to her lips in token of silence,
      appeared on the threshold!"</p>

      <p>"She of the turkois eyes and flaxen ringlets, for a hundred
      pistoles!"&mdash;cried Gonzaga. "Such then was the bird's nest
      that made him so mad a truant!"</p>

      <p>"As she retreated into the house," resumed Nignio, without
      noticing the interruption, "his highness followed, hat in hand,
      with the deference due to a gouvernante of Flanders. But as the
      house was little better than a shed of boards, by drawing a
      trifle nearer the porch, not a syllable of their mutual
      explanation escaped me.</p>

      <p>"'Are you a follower of Don John?'&mdash;was the first demand
      of the damsel. 'Do you belong to the party of the
      States?'&mdash;the next; to both which questions, a negative was
      easily returned. After listening to the plea, fluently set forth
      by the prince, that he was simply a Zealand burgess, travelling
      on his own errand, and sorely in fear of falling in (God wot)
      with either Protestants or Papists, the damsel appeared to hail
      the arrival of so congenial an ally as a blessing; acquainted him
      with a rash frankness of speech worthy of his own, that she was
      journeying from the Ardennes towards the frontier of Brabant,
      where her father was in high command; that the duenna her
      companion, outwearied by the exercise, was taking her siesta
      within; for that her pacing nag, having cast a shoe on
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg047" id=
      "pg047">047</a></span>reaching the wood, the ferryman had
      undertaken to conduct to the nearest smithy the venerable
      chaplain and serving-man constituting her escort.</p>

      <p>"'Half a league from hence,' said she, 'my father's people are
      in waiting to escort me during the rest of my journey.'</p>

      <p>"' Yet surely, gentle lady,' observed the prince, 'considering
      the military occupation of the province, your present protection
      is somewhat of the weakest?'&mdash;</p>

      <p>"'It was expressly so devised by my father,' replied the
      open-hearted girl. 'The Spanish cavaliers are men of honour, who
      war not against women and almoners. A more powerful attendance
      were more likely to provoke animosity. Feebleness is sometimes
      the best security.'</p>

      <p>"'<i>Home</i> is a woman's only security in times like
      these!'&mdash;cried the prince with animation.</p>

      <p>"'And therefore to my home am I recalled,' rejoined the young
      girl, with a heavy sigh. 'Since my mother's death, I have been
      residing with her sister in the Ardennes. But my good aunt having
      had the weakness to give way to my instances, and carry me to
      Namur last summer, to take part in the entertainments offered to
      the Queen of Navarre, my father has taken offence at both of us;
      and I am sent for home to be submitted to sterner keeping.'</p>

      <p>"You will believe that, ere all this was mutually explained,
      more time had elapsed than I take in the telling it; and I could
      perceive by the voices of the speakers that they had taken seats,
      and were awaiting, without much impatience, the return of the
      ferryman. The compassion of the silly child was excited by the
      severe accident which the stranger described as the origin of his
      fractures and contusions; nor need I tell you that the persuasive
      voice and deportment of Don John are calculated to make even a
      more experienced one than this pretty Ulrica forget his unseemly
      aspect and indigent apparel."</p>

      <p>"And all this time the careful gouvernante snored within, and
      the obsequious aide-de-camp held at the door the bridles of the
      Mecklenburgers"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Precisely. Nor found I the time hang much heavier than the
      prince; for at first mistrustful, like yourself, that the
      reconnaissance into which he had beguiled me was a mere pretext,
      I was not sorry to ascertain, sigh by sigh, and word by word, the
      grounds on which he stood with the enemy. And you should have
      heard how artfully he contrived to lead her back to the fêtes of
      Namur; asking, as with the curiosity of a bumpkin, the whole
      details of the royal entertainments! No small mind had I to rush
      in and chuck the hussy into the torrent before me, when I heard
      the little fiend burst forth into the most genuine and
      enthusiastic praises of the royal giver of the feast,&mdash;'So
      young, so handsome, so affable, so courteous, so passing the
      kingliness of kings.' She admitted, moreover, that it was her
      frantic desire of beholding face to face the hero of Lepanto,
      which had produced the concession on the part of her kinswoman so
      severely visited by her father.</p>

      <p>"'But surely,' pleaded this thoughtless prattler, 'one may
      admire the noble deportment of a Papist, and perceive the native
      goodness beaming in his eyes, without peril of salvation? This
      whole morning hath my father's chaplain (who will be here anon)
      been giving scripture warrant that I have no right to importune
      heaven with my prayers for the conversion of Don John:&mdash;Yet,
      as my good aunt justly observes, the great grandson of Mary of
      Burgundy has his pedestal firm in our hearts, beyond reach of
      overthrow from all the preachments of the Reformers'"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"And you did not fling the bridles to the devil, and rush in
      to the rescue of the unguarded soldier thus mischievously
      assailed?"&mdash;cried Gonzaga.</p>

      <p>"It needed not! The old lady could not sleep for ever; and I
      had the comfort to hear her rouse herself, and suitably reprehend
      the want of dignity of her charge in such strange familiarity
      with strangers. To which the pretty Ulrica replied, 'That it was
      no fault of hers if people wanted to convert a child into a
      woman!' A moment afterwards and the ferryman and cortège arrived
      together; and a more glorious figure <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg048" id="pg048">048</a></span>of fun than
      the chaplain of the heretic general hath seldom bestridden a
      pacing nag! However, I was too glad of his arrival to be
      exceptious; and the whole party were speedily embarked in the
      ferry, taking their turn as the first arrived at the spot, which
      we twain abided, watching the punt across the stream, which, in
      consequence of the strength of the current, it was indispensable
      to float down some hundred yards, in order to reach the opposite
      shore.</p>

      <p>"Hat in hand stood the prince, his eyes fixed upon the
      precious freight, and those of Ulrica fixed in return upon her
      new and pleasant acquaintance; when, Jesu Maria!&mdash;as every
      thing that is evil ordained it,&mdash;behold, the newly-shod
      palfrey of the pretty Brabançonne, irritated, perhaps, by the
      clumsy veterinaryship of a village smithy, began suddenly to rear
      and plunge, and set at defiance the old dunderhead by whom it was
      held!&mdash;The ass of a ferryman, in his eagerness to lend his
      aid, let go his oar into the stream; and between the awkwardness
      of some and the rashness of others, in a moment the whole party
      were carried round by the eddy of the Dyle!&mdash;The next, and
      Ulrica was struggling in the waters"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"And the next, in the arms of the prince, who had plunged in
      to her rescue!"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"You know him too well not to foresee all that follows. Take
      for granted, therefore, the tedious hours spent at the
      ferry-house, in restoring to consciousness the exhausted women,
      half-dead with cold and fright. Under the unguarded excitement of
      mind produced by such an incident, I expected indeed every moment
      the self-betrayal of my companion; but <i>that</i> evil we
      escaped. And when, late in the evening, the party was
      sufficiently recovered to proceed, I was agreeably surprised to
      find that Don John was alive to the danger of escorting the fair
      Ulrica even so far as the hamlet, where her father's people were
      in waiting."</p>

      <p>"And where he had been inevitably recognized!"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"The certainty of falling in with the troopers of Horn,
      rendered it expedient for us to return to Namur with only half
      the object of his highness accomplished. But the babble of the
      old chaplain had acquainted us with nearly all we wanted to
      know,&mdash; namely, the number and disposal of the Statists, and
      the position taken up by the English auxiliaries."</p>

      <p>"And this second parting from Ulrica?"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Was a parting as between friends for life! The first had been
      the laughing farewell of pleasant acquaintance. But now, ere she
      bade adieu to the gallant preserver of her life, she shred a
      tress of her silken hair, still wet with the waters of the Dyle,
      which she entreated him to keep for her sake. In return, he
      placed upon her finger the ruby presented to him by the Doge of
      Venice, bearing the arms of the republic engraved on the setting;
      telling her that chance had enabled him to confer an obligation
      on the governor of the Netherlands; and that, in any strait or
      peril, that signet, dispatched in his name to Don John of
      Austria, would command his protection."</p>

      <p>"As I live, a choice romance!&mdash;almost worthy the pages of
      our matchless Boccaccio!" cried the Italian. "A thousand pities
      but that the whole batch of Orangeists had been carried down the
      Dyle!&mdash;However, the enemy's lines lie between them. They
      will meet no more. The Calvinist colonel has doubtless his
      daughter under lock and key; and his highness has too much work
      cut out for him by his rebels, to have time for peeping through
      the keyhole.&mdash;So now, good-night.&mdash;For love-tales are
      apt to beget drowsiness; and i'faith we must be a-foot by break
      of day."</p>

      <p>And having betaken himself to the chamber provided for him,
      Ottavio Gonzaga lost not an hour or a syllable, in transcribing
      all he had learned from the Spanish aide-de-camp; that the state
      of mind and feeling of the young viceroy might be speedily laid
      open to the full and uncongenial investigation of his royal
      brother of the Escurial. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg049"
      id="pg049">049</a></span></p>

      <h3>Part II.</h3>

      <p>A fortnight afterwards, was fought that famous battle of
      Gembloux, which added a new branch to the laurels of Don John of
      Austria; and constitutes a link of the radiant chain of military
      glories which binds the admiration of Europe to the soil of one
      of the obscurest of its countries!&mdash;Gembloux, Ramillies,
      Nivelle, Waterloo, lie within the circuit of a morning's journey,
      as well as within the circle of eternal renown.</p>

      <p>By this brilliant triumph of the royalists, six thousand
      men-at-arms, their standards, banners, and artillery, were lost
      to the States. The cavalry of Spain, under the command of Ottavio
      Gonzaga, performed prodigies of valour; and the vanguard, under
      that of Gaspardo Nignio, equally distinguished itself. But the
      heat of the action fell upon the main body of the army, which had
      marched from Namur under the command of Don John; being composed
      of the Italian reinforcements dispatched to him from Parma by
      desire of the Pope, under the command of his nephew, Prince
      Alexander Farnese.</p>

      <p>It was noticed, however, with surprise, that when the generals
      of the States&mdash;the Archduke Matthias, and Prince of
      Orange&mdash;retreated in dismay to Antwerp, Don John, instead of
      pursuing his advantage with the energy of his usual habits,
      seemed to derive little satisfaction or encouragement from his
      victory. It might be, that the difficulty of controlling the
      predatory habits of the German and Burgundian troops wearied his
      patience; for scarce a day passed but there issued some new
      proclamation, reproving the atrocious rapacity and lawless
      desperation of the army. But neither Gonzaga nor Nignio had much
      opportunity of judging of the real cause of his cheerlessness;
      for, independent of the engrossing duties of their several
      commands, the leisure of Don John was entirely bestowed upon his
      nephew, Alexander Farnese, who, only a few years his junior in
      age, was almost a brother in affection.</p>

      <p>To him alone were confided the growing cares of his
      charge&mdash;the increasing perplexities of his mind. To both
      princes, the name of Ulrica had become, by frequent repetition, a
      sacred word; and though Don John had the comfort of knowing that
      her father, the Count de Cergny, was unengaged in the action of
      Gembloux, his highness had reason to fear that the regiment of
      Hainaulters under his command, constituted the garrison of one or
      other of the frontier fortresses of Brabant, to which it was now
      his duty to direct the conquering arms of his captains.</p>

      <p>The army of the States having taken refuge within the walls of
      Antwerp, the royalists, instead of marching straight to Brussels,
      according to general expectation, effected in the first instance
      the reduction of Tirlemont, Louvain, D'Arschot, Sichem, and
      Diest,&mdash;Nivelle, the capital of Walloon Brabant, next
      succumbed to their arms&mdash;Maubeuge, Chimay,
      Barlaimont;&mdash;and, after a severe struggle, the new and
      beautiful town of Philippeville.</p>

      <p>But these heroic feats were not accomplished without a
      tremendous carnage, and deeds of violence at which the soul
      sickened. At Sichem, the indignation of the Burgundians against a
      body of French troops which, after the battle of Gembloux, had
      pledged itself never again to bear arms against Spain, caused
      them to have a hundred soldiers strangled by night, and their
      bodies flung into the moat at the foot of the citadel; after
      which the town was given up by Prince Alexander to pillage and
      spoliation! Terrified by such an example, Diest and Leeuw
      hastened to capitulate. And still, at every fresh conquest, and
      while receiving day after day, and week after week, the
      submission of fortresses, and capitulation of vanquished chiefs,
      the anxious expectation entertained by Don John of an appeal to
      his clemency accompanying the Venetian ring, was again and again
      disappointed!&mdash;</p>

      <p>At times, his anxieties on Ulrica's account saddened him into
      utter despondency. He felt convinced that mischance had overtaken
      her. All <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg050" id=
      "pg050">050</a></span>his endeavours to ascertain the position of
      the Count de Cergny having availed him nothing, he trusted that
      the family must be shut up in Antwerp, with the Prince of Orange
      and Archduke; but when every night, ere he retired to a soldier's
      rugged pillow, and pressed his lips to that long fair tress which
      seemed to ensure the blessings of an angel of purity and peace,
      the hopes entertained by Don John of tidings of the gentle Ulrica
      became slighter and still more slight.</p>

      <p>He did not the more refrain from issuing such orders and
      exacting such interference on the part of Alexander Farnese, as
      promised to secure protection and respect to the families of all
      such officers of the insurgent army as might, in any time or
      place, fall into the hands of the royalists.</p>

      <p>To Alexander, indeed, to whom his noble kinsman was scarcely
      less endeared by his chivalrous qualities than the ties of blood,
      and who was fully aware of the motive of these instructions, the
      charge was almost superfluous. So earnest were, from the first,
      his orders to his Italian captains to pursue in all directions
      their enquiries after the Count de Cergny and his family, that it
      had become a matter of course to preface their accounts of the
      day's movements with&mdash;"<i>No</i> intelligence, may it please
      your highness, of the Count de Cergny!"</p>

      <p>The siege of Limbourg, however, now wholly absorbed his
      attention; for it was a stronghold on which the utmost faith was
      pinned by the military science of the States. But a breach having
      been made in the walls by the Spanish artillery under the command
      of Nicolo di Cesi, the cavalry, commanded in person by the Prince
      Alexander, and the Walloons under Nignio di Zuniga, speedily
      forced an entrance; when, in spite of the stanch resistance of
      the governor, the garrison laid down their arms, and the greater
      portion of the inhabitants took the oath of fealty to the
      king.</p>

      <p>Of all his conquests, this was the least expected and most
      desirable; in devout conviction of which, the Prince of Parma
      commanded a <i>Te Deum</i> to be sung in the churches, and
      hastened to render thanks to the God of Battles for an event by
      which further carnage was spared to either host.</p>

      <p>Escorted by his <i>état major</i>, he had proceeded to the
      cathedral to join in the august solemnization; when, lo! just as
      he quitted the church, a way-worn and heated cavalier approached,
      bearing despatches; in whom the prince recognised a faithful
      attendant of his household, named Paolo Rinaldo, whom he had
      recently sent with instructions to Camille Du Mont, the general
      charged with the reduction of the frontier fortresses of
      Brabant.</p>

      <p>"Be their blood upon their head!" was the spontaneous
      ejaculation of the prince, after perusing the despatch. Then,
      turning to the officers by whom he was escorted, he explained, in
      a few words, that the fortress of Dalem, which had replied to the
      propositions to surrender of Du Mont only by the scornful voice
      of its cannon, had been taken by storm by the Burgundians, and
      its garrison put to the sword.</p>

      <p>"Time that some such example taught a lesson to these
      braggarts of Brabant!"&mdash;responded Nignio, who stood at the
      right hand of Prince Alexander. "The nasal twang of their
      chaplains seems of late to have overmastered, in their ears, the
      eloquence of the ordnance of Spain! Yet, i'faith, they might be
      expected to find somewhat more unction in the preachments of our
      musketeers than the homilies of either Luther or Calvin!"</p>

      <p>He spoke unheeded of the prince; for Alexander was now engaged
      apart in a colloquy with his faithful Rinaldo, who had
      respectfully placed in his hands a ring of great cost and
      beauty.</p>

      <p>"Seeing the jewel enchased with the arms of the Venetian
      republic, may it please your highness," said the soldier, "I
      judged it better to remit it to your royal keeping."</p>

      <p>"And from whose was it plundered?" cried the prince, with a
      sudden flush of emotion.</p>

      <p>"From hands that resisted not!" replied Rinaldo gravely. "I
      took it from the finger of the dead!"</p>

      <p>"And when, and where?"&mdash;exclaimed the prince, drawing him
      still further apart, and motioning to his train to resume their
      march to the States' house of Limbourg.</p>

      <p>"The tale is long and grievous, may it please your highness!"
      said Rinaldo. "To comprise it in the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg051" id="pg051">051</a></span>fewest words,
      know that, after seeing the governor of Dalem cut down in a brave
      and obstinate defence of the banner of the States floating from
      the walls of his citadel, I did my utmost to induce the Baron de
      Cevray, whose Burgundians carried the place, to proclaim quarter.
      For these fellows of Hainaulters, (who, to do them justice, had
      fought like dragons,) having lost their head, were powerless; and
      of what use hacking to pieces an exhausted carcass?&mdash;But our
      troops were too much exasperated by the insolent resistance and
      defiance they had experienced, to hear of mercy; and soon the
      conduits ran blood, and shrieks and groans rent the air more
      cruelly than the previous roar of the artillery. In accordance,
      however, with the instructions I have ever received from your
      highness, I pushed my way into all quarters, opposing what
      authority I might to the brutality of the troopers."</p>

      <p>"Quick, quick!"&mdash;cried Prince Alexander in anxious
      haste&mdash;"Let me not suppose that the wearer of this ring fell
      the victim of such an hour?"&mdash;</p>

      <p>It was in passing the open doors of the church that my ears
      were assailed with cries of female distresses:&mdash;nor could I
      doubt that even <i>that</i> sanctuary (held sacred by our troops
      of Spain!) had been invaded by the impiety of the German or
      Burgundian legions!&mdash;As usual, the chief ladies of the town
      had placed themselves under the protection of the high altar. But
      there, even there, had they been seized by sacrilegious
      hands!&mdash;The fame of the rare beauty of the daughter of the
      governor of Dalem, had attracted, among the rest, two daring
      ruffians of the regiment of Cevray."</p>

      <p>"You sacrificed them, I trust in GOD, on the
      spot?"&mdash;demanded the prince, trembling with emotion. "You
      dealt upon them the vengeance due?"</p>

      <p>"Alas! sir, the vengeance they were mutually dealing, had
      already cruelly injured the helpless object of the contest!
      Snatched from the arms of the Burgundian soldiers by the fierce
      arm of a German musketeer, a deadly blow, aimed at the ruffian
      against whom she was wildly but vainly defending herself; had
      lighted on one of the fairest of human forms! Cloven to the bone,
      the blood of this innocent being, scarce past the age of
      childhood, was streaming on her assailants; and when, rushing in,
      I proclaimed, in the name of God and of your highness, quarter
      and peace, it was an insensible body I rescued from the grasp of
      pollution!"</p>

      <p>"Unhappy Ulrica!" faltered the prince, "and oh! my more
      unhappy kinsman!"</p>

      <p>"Not altogether hopeless," resumed Rinaldo; "and apprized, by
      the sorrowful ejaculations of her female companions when relieved
      from their personal fears, of the high condition of the victim, I
      bore the insensible lady to the hospital of Dalem; and the utmost
      skill of our surgeons was employed upon her wounds. Better had it
      been spared!&mdash;The dying girl was roused only to the
      endurance of more exquisite torture; and while murmuring a
      petition for 'mercy&mdash;mercy to her <i>father</i>!' that
      proved her still unconscious of her family misfortunes, she
      attempted in vain to take from her finger the ring I have had the
      honour to deliver to your highness:&mdash;faltering with her last
      breath, 'for <i>his</i> sake, Don John will perhaps show mercy to
      my poor old father!'"&mdash;</p>

      <p>Prince Alexander averted his head as he listened to these
      mournful details.</p>

      <p>"She is at rest, then?"&mdash;said he, after a pause.</p>

      <p>"Before nightfall, sir, she was released."&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Return in all haste to Dalem, Rinaldo," rejoined the prince,
      "and complete your work of mercy, by seeing all honours of
      interment that the times admit, bestowed on the daughter of the
      Comte de Cergny!"</p>

      <p>Weary and exhausted as he was, not a murmur escaped the lips
      of the faithful Rinaldo as he mounted his horse, and hastened to
      the discharge of his new duty. For though habituated by the
      details of that cruel and desolating warfare to spectacles of
      horror&mdash;the youth&mdash;the beauty&mdash;the
      innocence&mdash;the agonies of Ulrica, had touched him to the
      heart; nor was the tress of her fair hair worn next the heart of
      Don John of Austria, more fondly treasured, than the one this
      rude soldier had shorn from the brow of death, in the ward of a
      public hospital, albeit its silken gloss was tinged with
      blood!&mdash; <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg052" id=
      "pg052">052</a></span> Scarcely a month had elapsed after the
      storming of Dalem, when a terrible rumour went forth in the camp
      of Bouge, (where Don John had intrenched his division of the
      royalist army,) that the governor of the Netherlands was attacked
      by fatal indisposition!&mdash;For some weeks past, indeed, his
      strength and spirit had been declining. When at the village of
      Rymenam on the Dyle, near Mechlin, (not far from the ferry of the
      wood,) he suffered himself to be surprised by the English troops
      under Horn, and the Scotch under Robert Stuart, the unusual
      circumstance of the defeat of so able a general was universally
      attributed to prostration of bodily strength.</p>

      <p>When it was soon afterwards intimated to the army that he had
      ceded the command to his nephew, Prince Alexander Farnese, regret
      for the origin of his secession superseded every other
      consideration.</p>

      <p>For the word had gone forth that he was to die!&mdash;In the
      full vigour of his manhood and energy of his soul, a fatal blow
      had reached Don John of Austria!&mdash;</p>

      <p>A vague but horrible accusation of poison was generally
      prevalent!&mdash;For his leniency towards the Protestants had
      engendered a suspicion of heresy, and the orthodoxy of Philip II.
      was known to be remorseless; and the agency of Ottavio Gonzaga at
      hand!&mdash;</p>

      <p>But the kinsman who loved and attended him knew better. From
      the moment Prince Alexander beheld the ring of Ulrica glittering
      on his wasted hand, he entertained no hope of his recovery; and
      every time he issued from the tent of Don John, and noted the
      groups of veterans praying on their knees for the restoration of
      the son of their emperor, and heard the younger soldiers calling
      aloud in loyal affection upon the name of the hero of Lepanto,
      tears came into his eyes as he passed on to the discharge of his
      duties. For he knew that their intercessions were in
      vain&mdash;that the hours of the sufferer were numbered. In a
      moment of respite from his sufferings, the sacraments of the
      church were administered to the dying prince; having received
      which with becoming humility, he summoned around him the captains
      of the camp, and exhorted them to zeal in the service of Spain,
      and fidelity to his noble successor in command.</p>

      <p>It was the 1st of October, the anniversary of the action of
      Lepanto, and on a glorious autumnal day of golden sunshine, that,
      towards evening, he ordered the curtains of his tent to be drawn
      aside, that he might contemplate for the last time the creation
      of God!&mdash;</p>

      <p>Raising his head proudly from a soldier's pillow, he uttered
      in hoarse but distinct accents his last request, that his body
      might be borne to Spain, and buried at the feet of his father.
      For his eyes were fixed upon the glories of the orb of day, and
      his mind upon the glories of the memory of one of the greatest of
      kings.</p>

      <p>But that pious wish reflected the last flash of human reason
      in his troubled mind. His eyes became suddenly inflamed with
      fever, his words incoherent, his looks haggard. Having caused
      them to sound the trumpets at the entrance of his tent, as for an
      onset, he ranged his battalions for an imaginary field of battle,
      and disposed his manoeuvres, and gave the word to charge against
      the enemy.<sup>18</sup> Then, sinking back upon his pillow, he
      breathed in subdued accents, "Let me at least avenge her innocent
      blood. Why, why could I not save thee, my Ulrica!"&mdash;</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>18: The foregoing details are strictly historical.</p>
      </div>

      <p>It was thus he died. When Nignio de Zuniga (cursing in his
      heart with a fourfold curse the heretics whom he chose to
      consider the murderers of his master) stooped down to lay his
      callous hand on the heart of the hero, the pulses of life were
      still!&mdash;</p>

      <p>There was but one cry throughout the camp&mdash;there was but
      one thought among his captains:&mdash;"Let the bravest knight of
      Christendom be laid nobly in the grave!" Attired in the suit of
      mail in which he had fought at Lepanto, the body was placed on a
      bier, and borne forth from his tent on the shoulders of the
      officers of his household. Then, having been saluted by the
      respect of the whole army, it was <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg053" id="pg053">053</a></span>transmitted from post to post
      through the camp, on those of the colonels of the regiments of
      all nations constituting the forces of Spain.&mdash;And which of
      them was to surmise, that upon the heart of the dead lay the
      love-token of a heretic?&mdash;A double line of troops, infantry
      and cavalry in alternation, formed a road of honour from the camp
      of Bouge to the gates of the city of Namur. And when the people
      saw, borne upon his bier amid the deferential silence of those
      iron soldiers, bareheaded and with their looks towards the earth,
      the gallant soldier so untimely stricken, arrayed in his armour
      of glory and with a crown upon his head, after the manner of the
      princes of Burgundy, and on his finger the ruby ring of the Doge
      of Venice, they thought upon his knightly qualities&mdash;his
      courtesy, generosity, and valour&mdash;till all memory of his
      illustrious parentage became effaced. They forgot the prince in
      the man,&mdash;"and behold all Israel mourned for Jonathan!"</p>

      <p>A regiment of infantry, trailing their halberts, led the
      march, till they reached Namur, where the precious deposit was
      remitted by the royalist generals, Mansfeldt, Villefranche, and
      La Cros, to the hands of the chief magistrates of Namur. By these
      it was bourne in state to the cathedral of St Alban; and during
      the celebration of a solemn mass, deposited at the foot of the
      high altar till the pleasure of Philip II. should be known
      concerning the fulfilment of the last request of Don John.</p>

      <p>It was by Ottavio Gonzaga the tidings of his death were
      conveyed to Spain. It was by Ottavio Gonzaga the king intimated,
      in return, his permission that the conqueror of Lepanto should
      share the sepulture of Charles V., and all that now remains to
      Namur in memory of one of the last of Christian knights, the
      Maccabeus of the Turkish hosts, who expired in its service and at
      its gates, is an inscription placed on its high altar by the
      piety of Alexander Farnese, intimating that it afforded a
      temporary resting place to the remains of DON JOHN of
      AUSTRIA.<sup>19</sup></p>

        <p>19: Thus far the courtesies of fiction. But for those who
        prefer historical fact, it may be interesting to learn the
        authentic details of the interment of one whose posthumous
        destinies seemed to share the incompleteness of his baffled
        life. In order to avoid the contestations arising from the
        transit of a corpse through a foreign state, Nignio di Zuniga
        (who was charged by Philip with the duty of conveying it to
        Spain, under sanction of a passport from Henri III.) caused it
        to be <i>dismembered</i>, and the parts packed in three
        budgets, (<i>bougettes</i>,) and laid upon packhorses!&mdash;On
        arriving in Spain, the parts were <i>readjusted with
        wires!&mdash;"On remplit le corps de bourre</i>," says the old
        chronicler from which these details are derived, "<i>et ainsi
        la structure en aiant été comme rétablie, on le revétit de ses
        armes, et le fit voir au roi, tout debout apuyé sur son bâton
        de général, de sorte qu'il semblait encore vivant. L'aspect
        d'un mort si illustre ayant excité quelques larmes, on le porta
        à l'Escurial dans l'Eglise de St Laurens auprez de son
        père</i>."</p>

        <p>Such is the account given in a curious old history
        (supplementary to those of D'Avila and Strada) of the wars of
        the Prince of Parma, published at Amsterdam early in the
        succeeding century. But a still greater insult has been offered
        to the memory of one of the last of Christian knights, in
        Casimir Delavigne's fine play of "Don Juan d'Autriche," where
        he is represented as affianced to a Jewess!</p>

      <h2>POEMS AND BALLADS OF GOETHE.</h2>

      <h3>No. I.</h3>

      <p>It may be as well to state at the outset, that we have not the
      most distant intention of laying before the public the whole mass
      of poetry that flowed from the prolific pen of Goethe, betwixt
      the days of his student life at Leipsic and those of his final
      courtly residence at Weimar. It is of no use preserving the whole
      wardrobe of the dead; we do enough if we possess ourselves of his
      valuables&mdash;articles of sterling bullion that will at any
      time command their price in the market&mdash;as to worn-out and
      threadbare personalities, the sooner they are got rid of the
      better. Far be it from us, however, to depreciate or detract from
      the merit of any of Goethe's productions. Few men have written so
      voluminously, and still fewer have written so well. But the curse
      of a most fluent pen, and of a numerous auditory, to whom his
      words were oracles, was upon him; and seventy volumes, more or
      less, which Cotta issued from his wareroom, are for the library
      of the Germans now, and for the selection of judicious editors
      hereafter. A long time must elapse after an author's death,
      before we can pronounce with perfect certainty what belongs to
      the trunk-maker, and what pertains to posterity. Happy the
      man&mdash;if not in his own generation, yet most assuredly in the
      time to come&mdash;whose natural hesitation or fastidiousness has
      prompted him to weigh his words maturely, before launching them
      forth into the great ocean of literature, in the midst of which
      is a Maelstrom of tenfold absorbing power!</p>

      <p>From the minor poems, therefore, of Goethe, we propose, in the
      present series, to select such as are most esteemed by competent
      judges, including, of course, ourselves. We shall not follow the
      example of dear old Eckermann, nor preface our specimens by any
      critical remarks upon the scope and tendency of the great
      German's genius; neither shall we divide his works, as
      characteristic of his intellectual progress, into eras or into
      epochs; still less shall we attempt to institute a regular
      comparison between his merits and those of Schiller, whose finest
      productions (most worthily translated) have already enriched the
      pages of this Magazine. We are doubtless ready at all times to
      back our favourite against the field, and to maintain his
      intellectual superiority even against his greatest and most
      formidable rival. We know that he is the showiest, and we feel
      convinced that he is the better horse of the two; but talking is
      worse than useless when the course is cleared, and the start
      about to commence.</p>

      <p>Come forward, then, before the British public, O many-sided,
      ambidextrous Goethe, as thine own Thomas Carlyle might, or could,
      or would, or should have termed thee, and let us hear how the
      mellifluous Teutonic verse will sound when adapted to another
      tongue. And, first of all&mdash;for we yearn to know
      it&mdash;tell us how thy inspiration came? A plain answer, of
      course, we cannot expect&mdash;that were impossible from a
      German; but such explanation as we can draw from metaphor and
      oracular response, seems to be conveyed in that favourite and
      elaborate preface to the poems, which accordingly we may term
      the</p>

          <p>The morning came. Its footsteps scared away</p>

          <p class="i2">The gentle sleep that hover'd lightly o'er

          <p>I left my quiet cot to greet the day</p>

          <p>The sweet young flowers! how fresh were they and

          <p>The young day open'd in exulting splendour,</p>

          <p class="i2">And all around seem'd glad to gladden me.

          <p class="i2">A white and filmy essence 'gan to hover;</p>

          <p>It sail'd and shifted till it hemm'd me round,</p>

          <p class="i2">Then rose above my head, and floated over.</p>

          <p>No more I saw the beauteous scene unfolded&mdash;</p>

          <p class="i2">It lay beneath a melancholy shroud;</p>

          <p>And soon was I, as if in vapour moulded,</p>

          <p class="i2">Alone, within the twilight of the cloud.</p>

        <div class="stanza">

          <p class="i2">There on the peak and upland forest parted.</p>

          <p>O, how I panted for the first clear gleaming,</p>

          <p class="i2">That after darkness must be doubly bright!</p>

          <p>It came not, but a glory round me beaming,</p>

          <p class="i2">And I stood blinded by the gush of light.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
          <p>A moment, and I felt enforced to look,</p>

          <p class="i2">By some strange impulse of the heart's
          emotion;</p>

          <p>But more than one quick glance I scarce could brook,</p>

          <p class="i2">For all was burning like a molten ocean.</p>

          <p>There, in the glorious clouds that seem'd to bear her,</p>

          <p class="i2">A form angelic hover'd in the air;</p>

          <p>Ne'er did my eyes behold vision fairer,</p>

          <p class="i2">And still she gazed upon me, floating

        <div class="stanza">
          <p>"Yes! I have felt thy influence oft," I cried,</p>

          <p>"Thou brought'st me rest when Passion's lava tide</p>

          <p class="i2">I know thee now, and stand almost alone:</p>

      <p>This is a noble metaphysical and metaphorical poem, but purely
      German of its kind. It has been imitated, not to say travestied,
      at least fifty times, by crazy students and purblind
      professors&mdash;each of whom, in turn, has had an <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg057" id="pg057">057</a></span>interview with
      the goddess of nature upon a hill-side. For our own part, we
      confess that we have no great predilection for such mysterious
      intercourse, and would rather draw our inspiration from tangible
      objects, than dally with a visionary Egeria. But the fault is
      both common and national.</p>
      <hr />

      <p>The next specimen we shall offer is the far-famed <i>Bride of
      Corinth</i>. Mrs Austin says of this poem very happily&mdash;"An
      awful and undefined horror breathes throughout it. In the slow
      measured rhythm of the verse, and the pathetic simplicity of the
      diction, there is a solemnity and a stirring spell, which chains
      the feelings like a deep mysterious strain of music." Owing to
      the peculiar structure and difficulty of the verse, this poem has
      hitherto been supposed incapable of translation. Dr Anster, who
      alone has rendered it into English, found it necessary to depart
      from the original structure; and we confess that it was not
      without much labour, and after repeated efforts, that we
      succeeded in vanquishing the obstacle of the double rhymes. If
      the German scholar should perceive, that in three stanzas some
      slight liberties have been taken with the original, we trust that
      he will perceive the reason, and at least give us credit for
      general fidelity and close adherence to the text.</p>

      <p>In the days of his boyhood, and of Monk Lewis, Sir Walter
      Scott translated the Erl King, and since then it has been a kind
      of assay-piece for aspiring German students to thump and hammer
      at will. We have heard it sung so often at the piano by
      soft-voiced maidens, and hirsute musicians, before whose roaring
      the bull of Phalaris might be dumb, that we have been accustomed
      to associate it with stiff white cravats, green tea, and a
      superabundance of lemonade. But to do full justice to its
      unearthly fascination, one ought to hear it chanted by night in a
      lonely glade of the Schwartzwald or Spessart forest, with the
      wind moaning as an accompaniment, and the ghostly shadows of the
      branches flitting in the moonlight across the path.</p>

      Mignon?&mdash;the woman-child, in whose miniature, rather than
      portrait, it is easy to trace the original of fairy Fenella? We
      would that we could adequately translate the song, which in its
      native German is so exquisitely plaintive, that few can listen to

      for the thick purple haze of heat that hangs over its glassy
      surface. If you lie there for an hour or so, gazing into the

      <p>Our next extract smacks of the Troubadours, and would have
      better suited good old King René of Provence than a Paladin of
      the days of Charlemagne. Goethe has neither the eye of Wouverman
      nor Borgognone, and sketches but an indifferent battle-piece.
      Homer was a stark moss-trooper, and so was Scott; but the Germans

      <h2>MY FIRST LOVE.</h2>

      <h3>A SKETCH IN NEW YORK.</h3>

      <p>"Margaret, where are you?" cried a silver-toned voice from a
      passage outside the drawing-room in which I had just seated
      myself. The next instant a lovely face appeared at the door, its
      owner tripped into the room, made a comical curtsy, and ran up to
      her sister.</p>

      <p>"It is really too bad, Margaret; pa' frets and bustles about,
      nearly runs over me upon the stairs, and then goes down the
      street as if 'Change were on fire. Ma' yawns, and will not hear
      of our going shopping, and grumbles about money&mdash;always
      money&mdash;that horrid money! Ah! dear Margaret, our shopping
      excursion is at an end for to-day!"</p>

      <p>Sister Margaret, to whom this lamentation was addressed, was
      reclining on the sofa, her left hand supporting her head, her
      right holding the third volume of a novel. She looked up with a
      languishing and die-away expression&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Poor Staunton will be in despair," said her sister. "This is
      at least his tenth turn up and down the Battery. Last night he
      was a perfect picture of misery. I could not have had the heart
      to refuse to dance with him. How could you be so cruel,
      Margaret?"</p>

      <p>"Alas!" replied Margaret with a deep sigh, "how could I help
      it? Mamma was behind me, and kept pushing me with her elbow.
      Mamma is sometimes very ill-bred." And another sigh burst from
      the overcharged heart of the sentimental fair one.</p>

      <p>"Well," rejoined her sister, "I don't know why she so terribly
      dislikes poor Staunton; but to say the truth, our gallopade lost
      nothing by his absence. He is as stiff as a Dutch doll when he
      dances. Even our Louisianian backwoodsman here, acquits himself
      much more creditably."</p>

      <p>And the malicious girl gave me such an arch look, that I could
      not be angry with the equivocal sort of compliment paid to
      myself.</p>

      <p>"That is very unkind, Arthurine," said Margaret, her checks
      glowing with anger at this attack upon the graces of her
      admirer.</p>

      <p>"Don't be angry, sister," cried Arthurine, running up to her,
      throwing her arms round her neck, and kissing and soothing her
      till she began to smile. They formed a pretty group. Arthurine
      especially, as she skipped up to her sister, scarce touching the
      carpet with her tiny feet, looked like a fairy or a nymph. She
      was certainly a lovely creature, slender and flexible as a reed,
      with a waist one could easily have spanned with one's ten
      fingers; feet and hands on the very smallest scale, and of the
      most beautiful mould; features exquisitely regular; a complexion
      of lilies and roses; a small graceful head, adorned with a
      profusion of golden hair; and then large round clear blue eyes,
      full of mischief and fascination. She was, as the French say,
      <i>à croquer</i>.</p>

      <p>"Heigho!" sighed the sentimental Margaret. "To think of this
      vulgar, selfish man intruding himself between me and such a noble
      creature as Staunton! It is really heart-breaking."</p>

      <p>"Not quite so bad as that!" said Arthurine. "Moreland, as you
      know, has a good five hundred thousand dollars; and Staunton has
      nothing, or at most a couple of thousand dollars a-year&mdash;a
      mere feather in the balance against such a golden weight."</p>

      <p>"Love despises gold," murmured Margaret.</p>

      <p>"Nonsense!" replied her sister; "I would not even despise
      silver, if it were in sufficient quantity. Only think of the
      balls and parties, the fêtes and pic-nics! Saratoga in the
      summer&mdash;perhaps even London or Paris! The mere thought of it
      makes my mouth water."</p>

      <p>"Talk not of such joys, to be bought at such a price!" cried
      Margaret, quoting probably from some of her favourite novels.</p>

      <p>"Well, don't make yourself unhappy now," said Arthurine.
      "Moreland will not be here till tea-time; and there are six long
      hours to that. If we had only a few new novels to <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg070" id="pg070">070</a></span>pass the time!
      I cannot imagine why Cooper is so lazy. Only one book in a year!
      What if you were to begin to write, sister? I have no doubt you
      would succeed as well as Mrs Mitchell. Bulwer is so fantastical;
      and even Walter Scott is getting dull."</p>

      <p>"Alas, Howard!" sighed Margaret, looking to me for sympathy
      with her sorrows.</p>

      <p>"Patience, dear Margaret," said I. "If possible, I will help
      you to get rid of the old fellow. At any rate, I will try."</p>

      <p>Rat-tat-tat at the house door. Arthurine put up her finger to
      enjoin silence, and listened. Another loud knock. "A visit!"
      exclaimed she with sparkling eyes. "Ha! ladies; I hear the rustle
      of their gowns." And as she spoke the door opened, and the Misses
      Pearce came swimming into the room, in all the splendour of
      violet-coloured silks, covered with feathers, lace, and
      embroideries, and bringing with them an atmosphere of
      perfume.</p>

      <p>The man who has the good fortune to see our New York belles in
      their morning or home attire, must have a heart made of quartz or
      granite if he resists their attractions. Their graceful forms,
      their intellectual and somewhat languishing expression of
      countenance, their bright and beaming eyes, their slender
      figures, which make one inclined to seize and hold them lest the
      wind should blow them away, their beautifully delicate hands and
      feet, compose a sum of attraction perfectly irresistible. The
      Boston ladies are perhaps better informed, and their features are
      usually more regular; but they have something Yankeeish about
      them, which I could never fancy, and, moreover, they are dreadful
      blue-stockings. The fair Philadelphians are rounder, more
      elastic, more Hebe-like, and unapproachable in the article of
      small-talk; but it is amongst the beauties of New York that
      romance writers should seek for their Julias and Alices. I am
      certain that if Cooper had made their acquaintance whilst writing
      his books, he would have torn up his manuscripts, and painted his
      heroines after a less wooden fashion. He can only have seen them
      on the Battery or in Broadway, where they are so buried and
      enveloped in finery that it is impossible to guess what they are
      really like. The two young ladies who had just entered the room,
      were shining examples of that system of over-dressing. They
      seemed to have put on at one time the three or four dresses worn
      in the course of the day by a London or Paris fashionable.</p>

      <p>It was now all over with my <i>tête-à-tête</i>. I could only
      be <i>de trop</i> in the gossip of the four ladies, and I
      accordingly took my leave. As I passed before the parlour door on
      my way out, it was opened, and Mrs Bowsends beckoned me in. I
      entered, and found her husband also there.</p>

      <p>"Are you going away already, my dear Howard?" said the
      lady.</p>

      <p>"There are visitors up stairs."</p>

      <p>"Ah, Howard!" said Mrs Bowsends.</p>

      <p>"The workies<sup>20</sup> have carried the day," growled her
      husband.</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>20: The slang term applied to the mechanics and labourers, a
        numerous and (at elections especially) a most important class
        in New York and Philadelphia.</p>
      </div>

      <p>"That horrid Staunton!" interrupted his better half. "Only
      think now'&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Our side lost&mdash;completely floored. But you've heard of
      it, I suppose, Mister Howard?"</p>

      <p>I turned from one to the other in astonished perplexity, not
      knowing to which I ought to listen first.</p>

      <p>"I don't know how it is," whined the lady, "but that Mr
      Staunton becomes every day more odious to me. Only think now, of
      his having the effrontery to persist in running after Margaret!
      Hardly two thousand a-year "&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Old Hickory is preparing to leave Hermitage
      already.<sup>21</sup> Bank shares have fallen half per cent in
      consequence," snarled her husband.</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>21: The name of General Jackson's country-house and
        estate.</p>
      </div>

      <p>They were ringing the changes on poor Staunton and the new
      president.</p>

      <p>"He ought to remember the difference of our positions," said
      Mrs B., drawing herself up with much dignity.</p>

      <p>"Certainly, certainly!" said I. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg071" id="pg071">071</a></span>"And the governor's election is
      also going desperate bad," said Mr Bowsends.</p>

      <p>"And then Margaret, to think of her infatuation! Certainly she
      is a good, gentle creature; but five hundred thousand dollars!"
      This was Mrs Bowsends.</p>

      <p>"By no means to be despised," said I.</p>

      <p>The five hundred thousand dollars touched a responsive chord
      in the heart of the papa.</p>

      <p>"Five hundred thousand," repeated he. "Yes, certainly; but
      what's the use of that? All nonsense. Those girls would ruin a
      Croesus."</p>

      <p>"You need not talk, I'm sure," retorted mamma. "Think of all
      your bets and electioneering."</p>

      <p>"You understand nothing about that," replied her husband
      angrily. "Interests of the country&mdash;congress&mdash;public
      good&mdash;must be supported. Who would do it if we"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Did not bet," thought I.</p>

      <p>"You are a friend of the family," said Mrs Bowsends, "and I
      hope you will"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Apropos," interrupted her loving husband. "How has your
      cotton crop turned out? You might consign it to me. How many
      bales?"</p>

      <p>"A hundred; and a few dozen hogsheads of tobacco."</p>

      <p>"Some six thousand dollars per annum," muttered the papa
      musingly; "hm, hm."</p>

      <p>"As to that," said I negligently, "I have sufficient capital
      in my hands to increase the one hundred bales to two hundred
      another year."</p>

      <p>"Two hundred! two hundred!" The man's eyes glistened
      approvingly. "That might do. Not so bad. Well, Arthurine is a
      good girl. We'll see, my dear Mr Howard&mdash;we'll see. Yes,
      yes&mdash;come here every evening&mdash;whenever you like. You
      know Arthurine is always glad to see you."</p>

      <p>"And Mr and Mrs Bowsends?" asked I.</p>

      <p>"Are most delighted," replied the couple, smiling
      graciously.</p>

      <p>I bowed, agreeably surprised, and took my departure. I was
      nevertheless not over well pleased with a part of Mr Bowsends'
      last speech. It looked rather too much as if my affectionate
      father-in-law that was to be, wished to balance his lost bets
      with my cotton bales; and, as I thought of it, my gorge rose at
      the selfishness of my species, and more especially at the stupid
      impudent egotism of Bowsends and the thousands who resemble him.
      To all such, even their children are nothing but so many bales of
      goods, to be bartered, bought, and sold. And this man belongs to
      the <i>haut-ton</i> of New York! Five-and-twenty years ago he
      went about with a tailor's measure in his pocket&mdash;now a
      leader on 'Change, and member of twenty committees and
      directorships.</p>

      <p>But then Arthurine, with her seventeen summers and her lovely
      face, the most extravagant little doll in the whole city, and
      that is not saying a little, but the most elegant,
      charming&mdash;a perfect sylph! It was now about eleven months
      since I had first become acquainted with the bewitching creature;
      and, from the very first day, I had been her vassal, her slave,
      bound by chains as adamantine as those of Armida. She had just
      left the French boarding-school at St John's. That, by the by, is
      one of the means by which our mushroom aristocracy pushes itself
      upwards. A couple of pretty daughters, brought up at a
      fashionable school, are sure to attract a swarm of young fops and
      danglers about them; and the glory of the daughters is reflected
      upon the papa and mamma. And this little sorceress knew right
      well how to work her incantations. Every heart was at her feet;
      but not one out of her twenty or more adorers could boast that he
      had received a smile or a look more than his fellows. I was the
      only one who had perhaps obtained a sort of passive preference. I
      was allowed to escort her in her rides, walks, and drives; to be
      her regular partner when no other dancer offered, and suchlike
      enviable privileges. She flirted and fluttered about me, and hung
      familiarly on my arm, as she tripped along Broadway or the
      Battery by my side. In addition to all these little marks of
      preference, it fell to my share of duty to supply her with the
      newest novels, to furnish her with English Keepsakes and American
      Tokens and Souvenirs, and to provide the last fashionable songs
      and quadrilles. All this had cost me no small sum; but I consoled
      myself with <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg072" id=
      "pg072">072</a></span>the reflection, that my presents were made
      to the prettiest girl in New York, and that sooner or later she
      must reward my assiduities. Twice had fortune smiled upon me; in
      one instance, when we were standing on the bridge at Niagara,
      looking down on the foaming waters, and I was obliged to put my
      arm round her waist, for fear she should become dizzy and fall
      in&mdash;in doing which, by the by, I very nearly fell in myself.
      A similar thing occurred on a visit we made to the Trenton falls.
      That was all I had got for my pains, however, during the eleven
      months that I had trifled away in New York&mdash;months that had
      served to lighten my purse pretty considerably. It is the fashion
      in our southern states to choose our wives from amongst the
      beauties of the north. I had been bitten by the mania, and had
      come to New York upon this important business; but having been
      there nearly a year, it was high time to make an end of matters,
      if I did not wish to be put on the shelf as stale goods.</p>

      <p>This last reflection occurred to me very strongly as I was
      walking from the Bowsends' house towards Wall Street, when
      suddenly I caught sight of my fellow-sufferer Staunton. The
      Yankee's dolorous countenance almost made me smile. Up he came,
      with the double object of informing me that the weather was very
      fine, and of offering me a bite at his pigtail tobacco. I could
      not help expressing my astonishment that so sensitive and
      delicate a creature as Margaret should tolerate such a habit in
      the man of her choice.</p>

      <p>"Pshaw!" replied the simpleton. "Moreland chews also."</p>

      <p>"Yes, but he has got five hundred thousand dollars, and that
      sweetens the poison."</p>

      <p>"Ah!" sighed Staunton.</p>

      <p>"Keep up your courage, man; Bowsends is rich."</p>

      <p>The Yankee shook his head.</p>

      <p>"Two hundred thousand, they say; but to-morrow he may not have
      a farthing. You know our New Yorkers. Nothing but bets,
      elections, shares, railways, banks. His expenses are enormous;
      and, if he once got his daughters off his hands, he would perhaps
      fail next week."</p>

      <p>"And be so much the richer next year," replied I.</p>

      <p>"Do you think so?" said the Yankee, musingly.</p>

      <p>"Of course it would be so. Mean time you can marry the
      languishing Margaret, and do like many others of your fellow
      citizens; go out with a basket on your arm to the Greenwich
      market, and whilst your delicate wife is enjoying her morning
      slumber, buy the potatoes and salted mackerel for breakfast. In
      return for that, she will perhaps condescend to pour you out a
      cup of bohea. Famous thing that bohea! capital antidote to the
      dyspepsia!"</p>

      <p>"You are spiteful," said poor Staunton.</p>

      <p>"And you foolish," I retorted. "To a young barrister like you,
      there are hundreds of houses open."</p>

      <p>"And to you also."</p>

      <p>"Certainly."</p>

      <p>"And then I have this advantage&mdash;the girl likes me."</p>

      <p>"I am liked by the papa and the mamma, and the girl too."</p>

      <p>"Have you got five hundred thousand dollars?"</p>

      <p>"No."</p>

      <p>"Poor Howard!" cried Staunton, laughing.</p>

      <p>"Go to the devil!" replied I, laughing also.</p>

      <p>We had been chatting in this manner for nearly a quarter of an
      hour, when a coach drove out of Greenwich Street, in which I saw
      a face that I thought I knew. One of the Philadelphia steamers
      had just arrived. I stepped forward.</p>

      <p>"Stop!" cried a well-known voice.</p>

      <p>"Stop!" cried I, hastening to the coach door.</p>

      <p>It was Richards, my school and college friend, and my
      neighbour, after the fashion of the southern states; for he lived
      only about a hundred and seventy miles from me. I said good-by to
      poor simple Staunton, got into the coach, and we rattled off
      through Broadway to the American hotel.</p>

      <p>"For heaven's sake, George!" exclaimed my friend, as soon as
      we were installed in a room, "tell me what you are doing here.
      Have you quite forgotten house, land, and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg073" id="pg073">073</a></span>friends? You
      have been eleven months away."</p>

      <p>"True," replied I; "making love&mdash;and not a step further
      advanced than the first."</p>

      <p>"The report is true, then, that you have been harpooned by the
      Bowsends? Poor fellow! I am sorry for you. Just tell me what you
      mean to do with the dressed-up doll when you get her? A young
      lady who has not enough patience even to read her novels from
      beginning to end, and who, before she was twelve years old, had
      Tom Moore and Byron, <i>Don Juan</i> perhaps excepted, by heart.
      A damsel who has geography and the globes, astronomy and Cuvier,
      Raphael's cartoons and Rossini's operas, at her finger-ends; but
      who, as true as I am alive, does not know whether a mutton chop
      is cut off a pig or a cow&mdash;who would boil tea and
      cauliflowers in the same manner, and has some vague idea that
      eggs are the principal ingredient in a gooseberry pie."</p>

      <p>"I want her for my wife, not for my cook," retorted I, rather
      nettled.</p>

      <p>"Who does not know," continued Richards, "whether dirty linen
      ought to be boiled or baked."</p>

      <p>"But she sings like St Cecilia, plays divinely, and dances
      like a fairy."</p>

      <p>"Yes, all that will do you a deal of good. I know the family;
      both father and mother are the most contemptible people
      breathing."</p>

      <p>"Stop there!" cried I; "they are not one iota better or worse
      than their neighbours."</p>

      <p>"You are right."</p>

      <p>"Well, then, leave them in peace. I have promised to drink tea
      there at six o'clock. If you will come, I will take you with
      me."</p>

      <p>"Know then already, man. I will go, on one condition; that you
      leave New York with me in three days."</p>

      <p>"If my marriage is not settled," replied I.</p>

      <p>"D&mdash;&mdash;d fool!" muttered Richards between his
      teeth.</p>

      <p>Six o'clock struck as we entered the drawing-room of my future
      mother-in-law. The good lady almost frightened me as I went in,
      by her very extraordinary appearance in a tremendous grey gauze
      turban, fire-new, just arrived by the Henri Quatre packet-ship
      from Havre, and that gave her exactly the look of one of our
      Mississippi night-owls. Richards seemed a little startled; and
      Moreland, who was already there, could not take his eyes off this
      remarkable head-dress. Miss Margaret was costumed in pale green
      silk, her hair flattened upon each side of her forehead <i>a la
      Marguerite</i>, (see the <i>Journal des Modes,</i>) and looking
      like Jephtha's daughter, pale and resigned, but rather more
      lackadaisical, with a sort of "though-absent-not-forgot" look
      about her, inexpressibly sentimental and interesting. The
      contrast was certainly rather strong between old Moreland, who
      sat there, red-faced, thickset, and clumsy, and the airy slender
      Staunton, who, for fear of spoiling his figure, lived upon
      oysters and macaroon, and drank water with a rose leaf in it.</p>

      <p>I had brought the languishing beauty above described, Scott's
      <i>Tales of my Grandfather</i>, which had just appeared.</p>

      <p>"Ah! Walter Scott!" exclaimed she, in her pretty melting
      tones. Then, after a moment's pause, "The vulgar man has not a
      word to say for himself;" said she to me, in a low tone.</p>

      <p>"Wait a little," replied I; "he'll improve. It is no doubt his
      modest timidity that keeps his lips closed."</p>

      <p>Margaret gave me a furious look.</p>

      <p>"Heartless mocker!" she exclaimed.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Richards had got into conversation with Bowsends.
      The unlucky dog, who did not know that his host was a violent
      Adams-ite, and had lost a good five thousand dollars in bets and
      subscriptions to influence the voices of the sovereign people at
      the recent election, had fallen on the sore subject. He began by
      informing his host that Old Hickory would shortly leave the
      Hermitage to assume his duties as president.</p>

      <p>"The blood-thirsty backwoodsman, half horse, half alligator"
      interrupted Mr Bowsends.</p>

      <p>"Costs you dear, his election," said Moreland laughing.</p>

      <p>"Smokes out of a tobacco pipe like a vulgar German,"
      ejaculated Mrs Bowsends.</p>

      <p>"Not so very vulgar for that," said blundering Moreland;
      "tobacco has quite another taste out of a pipe."</p>

      <p>I gave him a tremendous dig in the back with my elbow.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg074" id="pg074">074</a></span>
      "Do you smoke out of a tobacco pipe, Mr Moreland?" enquired
      Margaret in her flute-like tones.</p>

      <p>Moreland stared; he had a vague idea that he had got himself
      into a scrape, but his straightforward honesty prevented him from
      prevaricating, and he blurted out&mdash;"Sometimes, miss."</p>

      <p>I thought the sensitive creature would have swooned away at
      this admission; and I had just laid my arm over the back of her
      chair to support her, when Arthurine entered the room. She gave a
      quick glance to me; it was too late to draw back my arm. She did
      not seem to notice any thing, saluted the company gaily and
      easily, tripped up to Moreland, wished him good
      evening&mdash;asked after his bets, his ships, his old dog
      Tom&mdash;chattered, in short, full ten minutes in a breath.
      Before Moreland knew what she was about, she had taken one of his
      hands in both of hers. But they were old acquaintances, and he
      might easily have been her grandfather. Meanwhile Margaret had
      somewhat recovered from the shock.</p>

      <p>"He smokes out of a pipe!" lisped she to Arthurine, in a tone
      of melancholy resignation.</p>

      <p>"Old Hickory is very popular in Pennsylvania," said Richards,
      resuming the conversation that had been interrupted, and
      perfectly unconscious, as Moreland would have said, of the shoals
      he was sailing amongst. "A Bedford County farmer has just sent
      him a present of a cask of Monongahela."</p>

      <p>"I envy him that present," cried Moreland. "A glass of genuine
      Monongahela is worth any money."</p>

      <p>This second shock was far too violent to be resisted by
      Margaret's delicate nerves. She sank back in her chair, half
      fainting, half hysterical. Her maids were called in, and with
      their help she managed to leave the room.</p>

      <p>"Have you brought her a book?" said Arthurine to me.</p>

      <p>"Yes, one of Walter Scott's."</p>

      <p>"Oh! then she will soon be well again," rejoined the
      affectionate sister, apparently by no means alarmed.</p>

      <p>Now that this nervous beauty was gone, the conversation became
      much more lively. Captain Moreland was a jovial sailor, who had
      made ten voyages to China, fifteen to Constantinople, twenty to
      St Petersburg, and innumerable ones to Liverpool and through his
      exertions had amassed the large fortune which he was now
      enjoying. He was a merry-hearted man, with excellent sound sense
      on all points except one&mdash;that one being the fair sex, with
      which he was about as well acquainted as an alligator with a
      camera-obscure. The attentions paid to him by Arthurine seemed to
      please the old bachelor uncommonly. There was a mixture of
      kindness, malice, and fascination in her manner, which was really
      enchanting; even the matter-of-fact Richards could not take his
      eyes off her.</p>

      <p>"That is certainly a charming girl!" whispered he to me.</p>

      <p>"Did not I tell you so?" said I. "Only observe with what
      sweetness she gives in to the old man's humours and fancies!"</p>

      <p>The hours passed like minutes. Supper was long over, and we
      rose to depart; when I shook hands with Arthurine, she pressed
      mine gently. I was in the ninety-ninth heaven.</p>

      <p>"Now, boys," cried worthy Moreland, as soon as we were in the
      streets, "it would really be a pity to part so early on so joyous
      an evening. What do you say? Will you come to my house, and knock
      the necks off half a dozen bottles?"</p>

      <p>We agreed to this proposal; and, taking the old seaman between
      us, steered in the direction of his cabin, as he called his
      magnificent and well-furnished house.</p>

      <p>"What a delightful family those Bowsends are!" exclaimed
      Moreland, as soon as we were comfortably seated beside a blazing
      fire, with the Lafitte and East India Madeira sparkling on the
      table beside us. "And what charming girls! 'You're getting
      oldish,' says I to myself the other day, 'but you're still fresh
      and active, sound as a dolphin. Better get married.' Margaret
      pleased me uncommonly, so I"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"Yes, my dear Moreland," interrupted I, "but are you sure that
      you please her?"</p>

      <p>"Pshaw! Five times a hundred thousand dollars! I tell you
      what, my lad, that's not to be met with every day."</p>

      <p>"Fifty years old," replied I. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg075" id="pg075">075</a></span> "Certainly, fifty years old,
      but stout and healthy; none of your spindle-shanked
      dandies&mdash;your Stauntons"&mdash;</p>

      <p>But Staunton smokes cigars, and not Dutch pipes."</p>

      <p>"I give that up. For Miss Margaret's sake, I'll burn my nose
      and mouth with those damned stumps of cigars."</p>

      <p>"Drinks no whisky," continued I. "He is president of a
      temperance society."</p>

      <p>"The devil fly away with him!" growled Moreland; "I wouldn't
      give up my whisky for all the girls in the world."</p>

      <p>"If you don't, she'll always be fainting away," replied I,
      laughing.</p>

      <p>"Ah! It's because I talked of the Monongahela that she began
      with her hystericals, and went away for all the evening! That's
      where the wind sits, is it? Well, you may depend I ain't to be
      done out of my grog at any rate."</p>

      <p>And he backed his assertion with an oath, swallowing off the
      contents of his glass by way of a clincher. We sat joking and
      chatting till past midnight during which time I flattered myself
      that I gave evidence of considerable diplomatic talents. As we
      were returning home, however, Richards doubted whether I had not
      driven the old boy rather too hard</p>

      <p>"No matter," replied I, "if I have only succeeded in ridding
      poor Margaret of him."</p>

      <p>Cool, calculating Richards shook his head.</p>

      <p>"I don't know what may come of it," said he; "but I do not
      think you are likely to find much gratitude for your
      interference."</p>

      <p>The next day was taken up in arranging matters of business
      consequent on the arrival of Richards. At least ten times I tried
      to go and see Arthurine, but was always prevented by something or
      other; and it was past tea-time when I at last got to the
      Bowsends' house. I found Margaret in the drawing-room, deep in a
      new novel.</p>

      <p>"Where is Arthurine?" I enquired.</p>

      <p>"At the theatre, with mamma and Mr Moreland," was the
      answer.</p>

      <p>"At the theatre!" repeated I in astonishment. They were
      playing Tom and Jerry, a favourite piece with the enlightened
      Kentuckians. I had seen the first scene or two at the New Orleans
      theatre, and had had quite enough of it.</p>

      <p>"That really <i>is</i> sacrificing herself!" said I,
      considerably out of humour.</p>

      <p>"The noble girl!" exclaimed Margaret. "Mr Moreland came to
      tea, and urged us so much to go"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"That she could not help going, to be bored and disgusted for
      a couple of hours."</p>

      <p>"She went for my sake," said Margaret sentimentally. "Mamma
      would have one of us go."</p>

      <p>"Yes, that is it," thought I. Jealousy would have been
      ridiculous. He fifty years old, she seventeen. I left the house,
      and went to find Richards.</p>

      <p>"What! Back so early?" cried he.</p>

      <p>"She is gone to the theatre with her mamma and Moreland."</p>

      <p>Richards shook his head.</p>

      <p>"You put a wasp's nest into the old fellow's brain-pan
      yesterday," said he. "Take care you do not get stung
      yourself."</p>

      <p>"I should like to see how she looks by his side," said I.</p>

      <p>"Well, I will go with you. The sooner you are cured the
      better. But only for ten minutes."</p>

      <p>There was certainly no temptation to remain longer in that
      atmosphere of whisky and tobacco fumes. It was at the Bowery
      theatre. The light swam as though seen through a thick fog; and a
      perfect shower of orange and apple peel, and even less agreeable
      things, rained down from the galleries. Tom and Jerry were in all
      their glory. I looked round the boxes, and soon saw the charming
      Arthurine, apparently perfectly comfortable, chatting with old
      Moreland as gravely, and looking as demure and self-possessed, as
      if she had been a married woman of thirty.</p>

      <p>"That is a prudent young lady," said Richards; "she has an eye
      to the dollars, and would marry Old Hickory himself, spite of
      whisky and tobacco pipe, if he had more money, and were to ask
      her."</p>

      <p>I said nothing.</p>

      <p>"If you weren't such an infatuated fool," continued my
      plain-spoken friend, I would say to you, let her take her own
      way, and the day after to-morrow we will leave New York."</p>

      <p>"One week more," said I, with an uneasy feeling about the
      heart. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg076" id=
      "pg076">076</a></span> At seven the next evening I entered what
      had been my Elysium, but was now, little by little, becoming my
      Tartarus. Again I found Margaret alone over a romance. "And
      Arthurine?" enquired I, in a voice that might perhaps have been
      steadier.</p>

      <p>"She is gone with mamma and Mr Moreland to hear Miss Fanny
      Wright."</p>

      <p>"To hear Miss Fanny Wright! the atheist, the revolutionist!
      What a mad fancy! Who would ever have dreamed of such a
      thing!"</p>

      <p>This Miss Fanny Wright was a famous lecturess, of the Owenite
      school, who was shunned like a pestilence by the fashionable
      world of New York.</p>

      <p>"Mr Moreland," answered Margaret, "said so much about her
      eloquence that Arthurine's curiosity was roused."</p>

      <p>"Indeed!" replied I.</p>

      <p>"Oh! you do not know what a noble girl she is. For her sister
      she would sacrifice her life. My only hope is in her."</p>

      <p>I snatched up my hat, and hurried out of the house.</p>

      <p>The next morning I got up, restless and uneasy; and eleven
      o'clock had scarcely struck when I reached the Bowsends' house.
      This time both sisters were at home; and as I entered the
      drawing-room, Arthurine advanced to meet me with a beautiful
      smile upon her face. There was nevertheless a something in the
      expression of her countenance that made me start. I pressed her
      hand. She looked tenderly at me.</p>

      <p>"I hope you have been amusing yourself these last two days,"
      said I after a moment's pause.</p>

      <p>"Novelty has a certain charm," replied Arthurine. "Yet I
      certainly never expected to become a disciple of Miss Fanny
      Wright," added she, laughing.</p>

      <p>"Really! I should have thought the transition from Tom and
      Jerry rather an easy one."</p>

      <p>"A little more respect for Tom and Jerry, whom <i>we</i>
      patronize&mdash;that is to say, Mr Moreland and our high
      mightiness," replied Arthurine, trying, as I fancied, to conceal
      a certain confusion of manner under a laugh.</p>

      <p>"I should scarcely have thought my Arthurine would have become
      a party to such a conspiracy against good taste," replied I
      gravely.</p>

      <p>"<i>My</i> Arthurine!" repeated she, laying a strong accent on
      the pronoun possessive. "Only see what rights and privileges the
      gentleman is usurping! We live in a free country, I believe?"</p>

      <p>There was a mixture of jest and earnest in her charming
      countenance. I looked enquiringly at her.</p>

      <p>"Do you know," cried she, "I have taken quite a fancy to
      Moreland? He is so good-natured, such a sterling character, and
      his roughness wears off when one knows him well."</p>

      <p>"And moreover," added I, "he has five hundred thousand
      dollars."</p>

      <p>"Which are by no means the least of his recommendations. Only
      think of the balls, Howard! I hope you will come to them. And
      then Saratoga; next year London and Paris. Oh! it will be
      delightful."</p>

      <p>"What, so far gone already?" said I, sarcastically.</p>

      <p>"And poor Margaret is saved!" added she, throwing her arms
      round her sister's neck, and kissing and caressing her. I hardly
      knew whether to laugh or to cry.</p>

      <p>"Then, I suppose, I may congratulate you?" said I, forcing a
      laugh, and looking, I have no doubt, very like a fool.</p>

      <p>You may so," replied Arthurine. "This morning Mr Moreland
      begged permission to transfer his addresses from Margaret to your
      very humble servant."</p>

      <p>"And you?"&mdash;</p>

      <p>"We naturally, in consideration of the petitioner's many
      amiable qualities, have promised to take the request into our
      serious consideration. For decorum's sake, you know, one must
      deliberate a couple of days or so."</p>

      <p>"Are you in jest or earnest, Arthurine?"</p>

      <p>"Quite in earnest, Howard."</p>

      <p>"Farewell, then!"</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>"'Fare-thee-well! and if for ever</p>

        <p>Still for ever fare-thee-well!'"</p>
      </div>

      <p>said Arthurine, in a half-laughing, half-sighing tone. The
      next instant I had left the room.</p>

      <p>On the stairs I met the beturbaned Mrs Bowsends, who led the
      way mysteriously into the parlour.</p>

      <p>"You have seen Arthurine?" said <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg077" id="pg077">077</a></span>she. "What a dear, darling
      child!&mdash;is she not? Oh! that girl is our joy and
      consolation. And Mr Moreland&mdash;the charming Mr Moreland! Now
      that things are arranged so delightfully, we can let Margaret
      have her own way a little."</p>

      <p>"What I have heard is true, then?" said I.</p>

      <p>"Yes; as an old friend I do not mind telling you&mdash;though
      it must still remain a secret for a short time. Mr Moreland has
      made a formal proposal to Arthurine."</p>

      <p>I do not know what reply I made, before flinging myself out of
      the room and house, and running down the street as if I had just
      escaped from a lunatic asylum.</p>

      <p>"Richards," cried I to my friend, "shall we start
      tomorrow?"</p>

      <p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Richards. "So you are cured of the New
      York fever? Start! Yes, by all means, before you get a relapse.
      You must come with me to Virginia for a couple of months."</p>

      <p>"I will so," was my answer.</p>

      <p>As we were going down to the steam-boat on the following
      morning, Staunton overtook us, breathless with speed and
      delight.</p>

      <p>"Wish me joy!" cried he. "I am accepted!"</p>

      <p>"And I jilted!" replied I with a laugh. "But I am not such a
      fool as to make myself unhappy about a woman."</p>

      <p>Light words enough, but my heart was heavy as I spoke them.
      Five minutes later, we were on our way to Virginia.</p>

      <h2>TRADITIONS AND TALES OF UPPER LUSATIA.</h2>

      <h3>No. II</h3>

      <h3>THE FAIRY TUTOR.</h3>

      <p>Discreet Reader!</p>

      <p>You have seen&mdash;and 'tis no longer ago than
      YESTERDAY!&mdash;you must well remember the picture&mdash;which
      showed you from the rough yet delicate&mdash;the humorous yet
      sympathetic and picturesque&mdash;the original yet insinuating
      pencil of a shrewd and hearty Lusatian mountaineer&mdash;the
      aerial, brilliant, sensitive, subtle, fascinating, enigmatical,
      outwardly&mdash;mirth-given, inwardly&mdash;sorrow-touched,
      congregated folk numberless&mdash;of the Fairies
      Proper!&mdash;showed them at the urgency of a rare and strange
      need&mdash;clung, in DEPENDENCY, to one fair, kind, good and
      happily-born Daughter of Man!&mdash;And what wonder?&mdash;The
      once glorious, but now forlorn spirits, leaning for one
      fate-burthened instant their trust upon the spirits ineffably
      favoured!&mdash;What wonder! that often as the revolution of ages
      brings on the appointed hour, the rebellious and outcast children
      of heaven must sue&mdash;to their keen
      emergency&mdash;help&mdash;oh! speak up to the height of the
      want, of the succour! and call it <i>a lent ray of grace</i>,
      from the rebellious and REDEEMED children of the earth!&mdash;And
      see, where, in the serene eyes of the soft Christian maiden, the
      hallowing influence shines!&mdash;Auspiciously begun, the awed
      though aspiring Rite, the still, the multitudinous, the mystical,
      prospers!&mdash;<i>Gratefully</i>, as for the boon inexpressibly
      worth&mdash;<i>easily</i>, as of their own transcending
      power&mdash;<i>promptly</i>, as though fearing that a benefit
      received could wax cold, the joyful Elves crown upon the bright
      hair of their graciously natured, but humanly and womanly weak
      benefactress&mdash;the wedded felicity of pure love!</p>

      <p>And the imaginary curtain has dropped! Lo, where it rises
      again, discovering to view our stage, greatly changed, and, a
      little perhaps, our actors!&mdash;Once more, attaching to the
      HUMAN DRAMA, slight, as though it were structured of cloud, of
      air, the same light and radiant MACHINERY! Once more, only that
      They, whom you lately saw tranquil, earnest even to
      pathos&mdash;"now are frolic"&mdash;enough and to
      spare!&mdash;Once more&mdash;THE FAIRIES.</p>

      <p>And see, too&mdash;where, centring in herself interest and
      action of the rapidly shifting scenery&mdash;ever again a
      beautiful granddaughter of Eve steps&mdash;free and fearless, and
      bouyant and bounding&mdash;our fancy-laid boards!&mdash;Ah! but
      how much unresembling the sweet maid!&mdash;<i>Outwardly</i>, for
      lofty-piled is the roof that ceils over the superb head of the
      modern Amazon, Swanhilda&mdash;more unlike <i>within</i>. Instead
      of the clear truth, the soul's gentle purity, the "plain and holy
      Innocence" of the poor fairy-beloved mountain child&mdash;SHE, in
      whose person and fortunes you are invited&mdash;for the next
      fifty minutes&mdash;to forget your own&mdash;harbours, fondly
      harbours, ill housemates of her virginal breast! a small,
      resolute, well-armed and well confederated garrison of unwomanly
      faults. Pride is there!&mdash;The iron-hard and the iron-cold!
      There Scorn&mdash;edging repulse with insult!&mdash;and
      envenoming insult with despair!&mdash;leaps up, in eager answer
      to the beseeching sighs, tears, and groans of earth-bent
      Adoration. And there is the indulged Insolency of a
      domineering&mdash;and as you will precipitately augur&mdash;an
      <i>indomitable</i> Will! And there is exuberant SELF-POWER, that,
      from the innermost mind, oozing up, out, distilling, circulating
      along nerve and vein, effects a magical metamorphosis! turns the
      nymph into a squire of arms; usurping even the clamorous and
      blood-sprinkled joy of man&mdash;the tempestuous and terrible
      CHASE, which, in the bosom of peace, imaging war, shows in the
      rougher lord of creation himself, as harsh, wild, and turbulent!
      Oh, how much other than yon sweet lily of the high Lusatian
      valleys, the shade-loving Flower, the good Maud&mdash;herself
      looked upon with <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg084" id=
      "pg084">084</a></span>love by the glad eyes of men, women,
      children, Fairies, and Angels! oh, other indeed! And yet, have
      you, in this thickly clustered enumeration of unamiable
      qualities, implicitly heard the CALL which must fasten, which has
      fastened, upon the gentle Maud's <i>haughty</i>
      antithesis&mdash;the serviceable regard, and&mdash;the FAVOUR,
      even of THE FAIRIES.</p>

      <p>The FAVOUR!!</p>

      <p>Hear, impatient spectator, the simple plot and its brief
      process. You are, after a fashion, informed with what studious,
      persevering, and unmerciful violation of all gentle decorum and
      feminine pity, the lovely marble-souled tyranness has, in the
      course of the last three or four years, turned back from her
      beetle-browed castle-gate, one by one, as they showed themselves
      there&mdash;a hundred, all worthily born&mdash;otherwise more and
      less meritorious&mdash;petitioners for that
      whip-and-javelin-bearing hand. You are NOW to know, that upon
      this very morning, an embassy from the willow-wearers
      all&mdash;or, to speak indeed more germanely to the matter, of
      the BASKET-BEARERS<sup>22</sup>, waited upon their beautiful
      enemy with an ultimatum and manifesto in one, importing first a
      requisition to surrender; then, in case of refusal to capitulate,
      the announcement that HYMEN having found in CUPID an inefficient
      ally, he was about associating with himself, in league offensive,
      the god MARS, with intent of carrying the Maiden-fortress by
      storm, and reducing the aforesaid wild occupants of the
      stronghold into captivity&mdash;whereunto she made
      answer&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>&mdash;&mdash;our castle's strength</p>

        <p>Will laugh a siege to scorn&mdash;</p>
      </div>

      <p>herself laughing outrageously to scorn the senders and the
      sent This crowning of wrong upon wrong will the Fairies, in the
      first place, wreak and right.</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>22: To German ears&mdash;to SEND A BASKET&mdash;is to REFUSE
        A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE.</p>
      </div>

      <p>But further, later upon the same unlucky day, the Kingdom of
      Elves, being in full council assembled in the broad light of the
      sun, upon the fair greensward; ere the very numerous, but not
      widely sitting diet had yet well opened its
      proceedings&mdash;"tramp, tramp, across the land," came, flying
      at full speed, boar-spear in hand, our madcap huntress; and
      without other note of preparation sounded than their own thunder,
      her iron-grey's hoofs were in the thick of the sage assembly,
      causing an indecorous trepidation, combined with devastation dire
      to persons and&mdash;wearing apparel.</p>

      <p>This wrong, in the second place, the Fairies will wreak and
      right.</p>

      <p>And all transgression and injury, under one procedure, which
      is&mdash;<i>summary</i>; as, from the character of the judges and
      executioners, into whose hands the sinner has fallen, you would
      expect; sufficiently prankish too. With one sleight of their
      magical hand they turn the impoverished heiress of ill-possessed
      acres forth upon the highway, doomed to earn, with strenuous
      manual industry, her livelihood; until, from the winnings of her
      handicraft, she is moreover able to make good, as far as this was
      liable to pecuniary assessment, the damage sustained under foot
      of her fiery barb by the Fairy realm; comfort with handsome
      presents the rejected suitors; and until, thoroughly tame, she
      yields into her softened and opened bosom, now rid of its
      intemperate inmates, an entrance to the once debarred and
      contemned visitant&mdash;LOVE.</p>

      <p>As to the way and style of the Fairy operations that carry out
      this drift, comparing the Two Tales, you will see, that omitting,
      as a matter that is related merely, not presented, that
      misadventure under the oak-tree&mdash;there is, in the chamber of
      Swanhilda, but a Fairy delegation active, whilst under the Sun's
      hill whole Elfdom is in presence; in that resplendent hollow,
      wearing their own lovely shapes; within the German castle-walls,
      in apt masquerade. There they were grave. Here, we have already
      said, that they are merry. There their office was to feel and to
      think. Here, if there be any trust in apparitions, they drink,
      and what is more critical for an Elfin lip&mdash;they eat!</p>

      <p>Lastly, to end the comparisons for our well-bred,
      well-dressed, and right courtly cavalier, who transacted between
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg085" id=
      "pg085">085</a></span>the Fairy Queen and the stonemason's
      daughter, him you shall presently see turned into a sort of Elfin
      cupbearer or court butler; not without fairy grace of person and
      of mind assuredly; not without a due innate sense of the
      beautiful, as his perfumed name (SWEETFLOWER) at the outset warns
      you; and, as the proximity of his function to her Majesty's
      person&mdash;for we do not here fall in with any thing like
      mention of a king&mdash;would suggest, independently of the
      delicately responsible part borne by him in the action, the chief
      stress of which you will find incumbent upon his capable
      shoulders.</p>

      <p>Such, in respect of the subject, is, thrice courteous and
      intelligent reader, the second piece of art, which we are glad to
      have the opportunity of placing before you, from our clever
      friend Ernst Willkomm's apparently right fertile easel. The
      second, answering to the first, LIKE and UNLIKE, you perceive, as
      two companion pictures should be.</p>

      <p>But it would be worse than useless to tell you that which you
      have seen and that which you will see, unless, from the
      juxtaposition of the two fables, there followed&mdash;a moral.
      They have, as we apprehend, a moral&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> one moral,
      and that a grave one, in common between them.</p>

      <p>Hitherto we have superficially compared THE FAIRIES' SABBATH
      and the FAIRY TUTOR. We now wish to develope a profounder analogy
      connecting them. We have compared them, as if ESTHETICALLY; we
      would now compare them MYTHOLOGICALLY&mdash;for, in our
      understanding, there lies at the very foundation of both tales A
      MYTHOLOGICAL ROOT&mdash;by whomsoever set, whether by Ernst
      Willkomm to-day, or by the population of the Lusatian
      mountains&mdash;three, six, ten centuries ago; or, in unreckoned
      antiquity, by the common Ancestors of the believers, who, in
      still unmeasured antiquity, brought the superstition of the
      Fairies out of central Asia to remote occidental Europe.</p>

      <p>This ROOT we are bold to think is&mdash;"A DEEPLY SEATED
      ATTRACTION, ALLYING THE FAIRY MIND TO THE PURITY AND INTEGRITY OF
      THE MORAL WILL IN THE MIND OF MEN." And first for the Tale which
      presently concerns us:&mdash;THE FAIRY TUTOR.</p>

      <p>SWEETFLOWER will beguile us into believing that the
      interposition of the Fairies in our Baroness's domestic
      arrangements, grows up, if one shall so hazardously speak, from
      TWO seeds, each bearing two branches&mdash;namely, from two
      wrongs, the one hitting, the other striking from,
      themselves&mdash;BOTH which wrongs they will AVENGE and AMEND. We
      take up a strenuous theory; and we deny&mdash;and we
      defy&mdash;SWEETFLOWER. Nay, more! Should our excellent friend,
      ERNST WILLKOMM, be found taking part, real or apparent, with
      SWEETFLOWER, we defy and we deny Ernst Willkomm. For in this
      mixed case of the Fairy wrong, we distinguish, first, INJURIES
      which shall be retaliated, and, as far as may be, compensated;
      and secondly, a SHREW, who is to be turned <i>into</i> a WIFE,
      being previously turned <i>out of</i> a shrew.</p>

      <p>We dare to believe that this last-mentioned end is the thing
      uppermost, and undermost, and middlemost in the mind of the
      Fairies; is, in fact, the true and <i>the sole final cause</i> of
      all their proceedings.</p>

      <p>Or that the <i>moral heart</i> of the poem&mdash;that root in
      the human breast and will, from which every true poem springs
      heavenward&mdash;is here the zeal of the spirits for <i>morally
      reforming Swanhilda</i>; is, therefore, that deep-seated
      attraction, which, as we have averred, essentially allies the
      inclination of the Fairies to the moral conscience in our own
      kind.</p>

      <p>One end, therefore, grounds the whole story, although two and
      more are proposed by <i>Sweetflower</i>. It is one that
      <i>satisfies</i> the moral reason in man; for it is no less than
      to cleanse and heal the will, wounded with error, of a human
      creature. That other, which he displays, with mock emphasis, of
      restitution to the downtrodden fairyhood, is an exotic, fair and
      slight bud, grafted into the sturdier indigenous stock. For let
      us fix but a steady look upon the thing itself, and what is there
      before us? a whim, a trick of the fancy, tickling the fancy. We
      are amused with a quaint calamity&mdash;a panic of caps and
      cloaks. We laugh&mdash;we cannot help it&mdash;as the pigmy
      assembly flies a thousand ways at once&mdash;grave councillors
      and all&mdash;throwing terrified somersets&mdash;hiding
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg086" id=
      "pg086">086</a></span>under stones, roots&mdash;diving into
      coney-burrows&mdash;"any where&mdash;any where"&mdash;vanishing
      out of harm's&mdash;if not out of dismay's&mdash;reach. In a tale
      of the Fairies, THE FANCY rules:&mdash;and the interest of such a
      misfortune, definite and not infinite, is congenial to the spirit
      of the gay faculty which hovers over, lives upon surfaces, and
      which flees abysses; which thence, likewise, in the moral sphere,
      is equal to apprehending resentment of a personal wrong, and a
      judicial assessment of damages&mdash;but NOT A DISINTERESTED
      MORAL END.</p>

      <p>What is our conclusion then? plainly that the dolorous
      overthrow of the fairy divan is no better than an
      invention&mdash;the device of an esthetical artist. We hold that
      Ernst Willkomm has <i>gratuitously</i> bestowed upon us the
      disastrous catastrophe; that he has done this, knowing the
      obligation which lies upon Fancy within her own chosen domain to
      <i>create</i>, because&mdash;there, Fancy listens and reads. The
      adroit Fairy delineator must wile over and reconcile the most
      sportive, capricious, and self-willed spirit of our
      understanding, to accept a purpose foreign to that spirit's
      habitual sympathies&mdash;a purpose solemn and austere&mdash;THE
      MORAL PURPOSE OF RESCUING A SIN-ENTANGLED HUMAN SOUL.</p>

      <p>Or, if Ernst Willkomm shall guarantee to us, that the
      reminiscences of his people have furnished him with the materials
      of this tale; if he is, as we must needs hope, who have freely
      dealt with you to believe that he is&mdash;honest: honest both as
      to the general character, and the particular facts of his
      representations&mdash;if, in short, the Lusatian Highlanders do,
      sitting by the bench and the stove, aver and protest that the
      said Swanhilda did overturn both council-board and
      councillors&mdash;then we say, upon this occasion, that which we
      must all, hundreds of times, declare&mdash;namely, that <i>The
      Genius of Tradition</i> is the foremost of artists; and further,
      that in this instance <i>an unwilled fiction</i>, determined by a
      necessity of the human bosom, has risen up <i>to mantle
      seriousness with grace</i>, as a free woodbine enclasps with her
      slender-gadding twines, and bedecks with her sweet bright
      blossoms, a towering giant of the grove.</p>

      <p>It will perhaps be objected, that the moral purity and
      goodness that are so powerful to draw to themselves the regard
      and care of the spiritual people, are wanting in the character of
      the over-bold Swanhilda. We have said that her <i>faults</i> are
      the CALL to the Fairies for help and reformation: but we may
      likewise guess that Virtue and Truth first won their love. It
      must be recollected that the faults which are extirpated from the
      breast of our heroine, are not such as, in our natural
      understanding of humanity, dishonour or sully. Taken away, the
      character may stand clear. It is quite possible that this gone,
      there shall be left behind a kind, good, affectionate, generous,
      noble nature.</p>

      <p>We are free, or, more properly speaking, we are bound to
      believe, that thus the Fairies left Swanhilda.</p>

      <p>As for Maud, we know&mdash;for she was told&mdash;that the
      Fairies loved her for herself ere they needed her aid. Hanging as
      it were upon that wondrous power to help which dwelt within
      her&mdash;her simple goodness&mdash;may we not say that the
      Fairies discover an ENFORCED attraction, when they afterwards
      approach the maiden for their own succour and salvation; as they
      do, a FREE attraction, when, in the person of Swanhilda, they
      disinterestedly attach themselves to reforming a fault for the
      welfare and happiness of her whom it aggrieves?</p>
      <hr />

      <p>We will now proceed, as in our former communication, to adduce
      instances from other quarters, confirming the fairy delineations
      offered by our tale; or which may tend generally to bring out its
      mythological and literary character.</p>

      <p>Two points would suggest themselves to us in the tale of the
      Fairy Tutor, as chiefly provoking comparison. The first
      is:&mdash;<i>The affirmed Presidency of the Fairies over human
      morals</i>, viewed as <i>a Shape of the Interest</i> which they
      take in the uprightness and purity of the human will.</p>

      <p>The second is:&mdash; <i>The Manner and Style of their
      operations</i>: or, THE FAIRY WAYS. In which we chiefly
      distinguish&mdash;1, The active presence of the Sprites in a
      human habitation. 2, Their masquerading. 3, Their dispatch of
      human victuals. 4, The liability of Elfin <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg087" id="pg087">087</a></span>limbs to human
      casualties. 5, The personality of that saucy Puck, our tiny
      ambassador elf.</p>

      <p>We are at once tempted and restrained by the richness of
      illustration, which presents itself under all these heads. The
      necessity of limitation is, however, imperious. This, and a wish
      for simplicity, dispose us to throw all under one more
      comprehensive title.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the reader has not entirely forgotten that in the
      remarks introductory to THE FAIRIES' SABBATH, having launched the
      question&mdash;what is a Fairy?&mdash;we offered him in the way
      of answer, <i>eight</i> elements of the Fairy Nature. Has he
      quite forgotten that for one of these&mdash;it was the
      third&mdash;we represented the Spirit under examination, as ONE
      WHICH AT ONCE SEEKS AND SHUNS MANKIND?</p>

      <p>The cursory treatment of this Elfin criterion will now
      compendiously place before the reader, as much illustration of
      the two above-given heads as we dare impose upon him.</p>

      <p>The popular Traditions of entire Western Europe variously
      attest for all the kinds of the Fairies, and for some orders of
      Spirits partaking of the Fairy character, the singularly
      composed, and almost self-contradictory traits of a
      <i>seeking</i> implicated and attempered with a <i>shunning</i>;
      of a shunning with a seeking. The inclination of our Quest will
      be to evidences of the <i>seeking</i>. The shunning will, it need
      not be doubted, take good care of itself.</p>

      <p>The attraction of the Fairy Species towards our own is,</p>

      <p>1. Recognised&mdash;in their GENERIC DESIGNATIONS.
      <br />
      2. Apparent&mdash;in their GOOD NEIGHBOURHOOD with us.
      <br />
      3. IN THEIR FREQUENTING AND ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES in the places
      of our habitual occupancy and resort.
      <br />
      4. IN THEIR CALLING OR CARRYING US into the places of their
      Occupancy and Resort; whether to return <i>hither</i>, or to
      remain <i>there</i>.
      <br />
      5. BY THEIR ALIGHTING UPON THE PATH, worn already with some
      blithe or some weary steps, OF A HUMAN DESTINY;&mdash;as
      friendly, or as unfriendly Genii.
      <br />

      <p>One is tempted to say that THE NATIONS, as if conscious of the
      kindly disposition inhering in the spiritual existences toward
      ourselves, have simultaneously agreed in conferring upon them
      titles of endearment and affection. The brothers Grimm
      write&mdash;"In Scotland they [The Fairies] are called <i>The
      Good People, Good Neighbours, Men of Peace;</i> in
      Wales&mdash;<i>The Family, The Blessing of their Mothers, The
      Dear Ladies;</i> in the old Norse, and to this day in the Faroe
      islands, <i>Huldufolk</i> (<i>The Gracious People;</i>) in
      Norway, <i>Huldre</i>;<sup>23</sup> and, in conformity with these

      <h3>GERMAN TRADITIONS</h3>

      <h3>No. CXLIX <i>The Dwarfs' Feet</i>.</h3>

      <p>"In old times the men dwelt in the valley, and round about
      them, in caves and clefts of the rock, the Dwarfs, <i>in amity
      and good neighbourhood</i> with the people, for whom they
      performed by night many a heavy labour. When the country folk,
      betimes in the morning, came with wains and implements, and
      wondered that all was ready done, the Dwarfs were hiding in the
      bushes, and laughed out loud. Frequently the peasants were angry
      when they saw their yet hardly ripe corn lying reaped upon the
      field; but when presently after hail and storm came on, and they
      could well know that probably not a stalk should have escaped
      perishing, they were then heartily thankful to the provident
      Dwarfs. At last, however, the inhabitants, by their sin, fooled
      away the grace and favour of the Dwarfs. These fled, and since
      then has no eye ever again beheld them. The cause was this
      following:&mdash;A herdsman had upon the mountain an excellent
      cherry-tree. One summer, as the fruit grew ripe, it befell that
      the tree was, for three following nights, picked, and the fruit
      carried, and fairly spread out in the loft, in which the herdsman
      had use to keep his cherries. The people said in the village,
      that doth no one other than the honest dwarflings&mdash;they come
      tripping along by night, in long mantles, with covered feet,
      softly as birds, and perform diligently for men the work of the
      day. Already often have they been privily watched, but one may
      not interrupt them, only let them, come and go at their listing.
      By such speeches was the herdsman made curious, and would fain
      have wist wherefore the Dwarfs hid so carefully their feet, and
      whether these were otherwise shapen than men's feet. When,
      therefore, the next year, summer again came, and the season that
      the Dwarfs did stealthily pluck the cherries, and bear them into
      the garner, the herdsman took a sackful of ashes, which he
      strewed round about the tree. The next morning, with daybreak, he
      hied to the spot; the tree was regularly gotten, and he saw
      beneath in the ashes the print of many geese's feet. Thereat the
      herdsman fell a-laughing, and made game, that the mystery of the
      Dwarfs was bewrayed; but these presently after brake down and
      laid waste their houses, and fled deeper away into their
      mountain. They harbour ill-will toward men, and withhold from
      them their help. That herdsman which had betrayed the Dwarfs
      turned sickly and half-witted, and so continued until his dying
      day!"</p>

      <p>There! Plucked amidst the lap of the Alps from its own
      hardily-nursed wild-brier, by the same tenderly-diligent
      hand<sup>27</sup> that brought home to us those other
      half-disclosed twin-buds of Helvetian tradition, you behold a
      third, like pure, more expanded blossom. Twine the three, young
      poet! into one soft-hued and "odorous chaplet," ready and meet
      for binding the smooth clear forehead of a Swiss Maud!&mdash;or

      <p>the men and the Dwarfs had unbroken intercourse of
      <i>borrowing and lending</i>. Many traditions touch the matter.
      Here is one resting upon it.</p>

      <h3>No. CLIV. <i>The Dwarfs near Dardesheim</i>.</h3>

      <p>"Dardesheim is a little town betwixt Halberstadt and
      Brunswick. Close to the north-east side, a spring of the clearest
      water flows, which is called the Smansborn,<sup>28</sup> and
      wells from a hill wherein formerly the Dwarfs dwelled. When the
      ancient inhabitants of the place needed a holiday dress, or any
      rare utensil for a marriage, they betook them to this Dwarf's
      Hill, knocked thrice, and with a well audible voice, told their
      occasion, adding&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>'Early a-morrow, ere sun-light,</p>

        <p>At the hill's door, lieth all aright.'</p>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>28: For LESSMANSBORN, <i>i.e.</i> LESSMANN'S WELL.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The Dwarfs held themselves for well requited if somewhat of
      the festival meats were set for them by the hill. Afterward
      gradually did bickerings interrupt the good understanding that
      was betwixt the Dwarfs' nation and the country folk. At the
      beginning for a short season; but, in the end, the Dwarfs
      departed away; because the flouts and gibes of many boors grew
      intolerable to them, as likewise their ingratitude for kindnesses
      done. Thenceforth none seeth or heareth any Dwarfs more."</p>

      <p>In <i>Auvergne</i>, Miss Costello has just now learned, how
      the men and the Fairies anciently lived upon the friendliest
      footing, nigh one another: how the <i>knowledge</i> and
      <i>commodious use</i> of the <i>Healing Springs</i> was owed by
      the former to these Good Neighbours: how, of yore, the powerful
      sprites, by rending athwart a huge rocky mound, opened an
      <i>innocuous channel</i> for <i>the torrent</i>, which used with
      its overflow to lay desolate arable ground and pasturage: how
      they were looked upon as being, in a general sense, <i>the
      protectors</i> against harm of the country: and, in fine, how the
      two orders of neighbours lived in long and happy communion of
      kind offices with one another; until, upon one unfortunate day,
      the ill-renowned freebooter, Aymerigot Marcel, with his ruffianly
      men-at-arms, having approached, by stealth, from his near-lying
      hold, stormed the romantically seated rock-mansion of the
      bountiful pigmies: who, scared, and in anger, forsook the land.
      Ever since the foul outrage, only a straggler may, now and then,
      be seen at a distance.</p>

      <p>Thus, too, the late <i>Brillat-Savarin</i>, from a sprightly,
      acute, brilliant Belles-letteriste, turned, for an hour, honest
      antiquary, lets us know how, upon the southern bank of the Rhone,
      flowing out from Switzerland, in the narrowly-bounded and, when
      he first quitted it, yet hidden valley of his birth:&mdash;The
      FAIRIES&mdash;elderly, not beautiful, but benevolent unmarried
      ladies&mdash;kept, while time was, open school in THE GROTTO,
      which was their habitation, for the young girls of the vicinity,
      whom they taught&mdash;SEWING.</p>

      <h4>3. We go on to exemplifying&mdash;ELFIN <i>Frequentation of,
      and Settlement with,</i> MAN.</h4>

      <p>The Fairies are drawn into the houses and to the haunts of men
      by manifold occasions and impulses. They halt on a journey. They
      celebrate marriages. They use the implements of handicraft. They
      purchase at the Tavern&mdash;from the Shambles, or in open
      Market. They <i>steal</i> from oven and field. They go through a
      house, blessing the rooms, the marriage-bed&mdash;and stand
      beside the unconscious cradle. They give dreams. They take part
      in the evening mirth. They pray in the churches. They
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg090" id=
      "pg090">090</a></span>seem to work in the mines. Drawn by magical
      constraint into the garden, they invite themselves within doors.
      They dance in the churchyard.<sup>29</sup> They make themselves
      the wives and the paramours of men; or the serviceable hobgoblin
      fixes himself, like a cat, in the house&mdash;once and for
      ever.</p>

      <p>We present traditions for illustrating some of these points,

      <h3>THEY HALT ON A JOURNEY.</h3>

      <h3>No. XXXV. <i>The Count of Hoia</i>.</h3>

      <p>"There did appear once to a count of Hoia, a little mauling in
      the night, and, as the count was alarmed, said to him he should
      have no fear: he had a word to sue unto him, and begged that he
      should not be denied. The count answered, if it were a thing
      possible to do, and should be never burthensome to him and his,
      he will gladly do it. The manling said&mdash;'There be some that
      desire to come to thee this ensuing night, into thy house, and to
      make their stopping. Wouldst thou so long lend them kitchen and
      hall, and bid thy domestics that they go to bed, and none look
      after their ways and works, neither any know thereof, save only
      thou? They will show them, therefore, grateful. Thou and thy line
      shall have cause of joy, and in the very least matter shall none
      hurt happen unto thee, neither to any that belong to thee.'
      Whereunto the count assented. Accordingly, upon the following
      night, they came like a cavalcade, marching over the drawbridge
      to the house; one and all&mdash;tiny folk, such as they use to
      describe the hill manlings. They cooked in the kitchen, fell too,
      and rested, and nothing seemed otherwise than as if a great
      repast were in preparing. Thereafter, nigh unto morn, as they
      will again depart, comes the little manling a second time to the
      count, and after conning him thanks, handed him a <i>sword</i>, a
      <i>salamander cloth</i>, and a <i>golden ring</i>, in which was
      RED LION set above&mdash;advertising him, withal, that he and his
      posterity shall well keep these three pieces, and so long as they
      had them all together, should it go with fair accordance and well
      in the county; but so soon as they shall be parted from one
      another, shall it be a sign that nothing good impendeth for the
      county. Accordingly, the red lion ever after, when any of the
      stem is near the point of dying, hath been seen to wax wan.</p>

      <p>"Howsoever, at the time that Count Job and his brothers were
      minors, and Francis of Halle governor in the country, two of the
      pieces&mdash;viz., the Sword and the Salamander Cloth, were taken
      away; but the Ring remained with the lordship unto an end.
      Whither it afterwards went is not known."</p>

      <h3>THEY HOLD A WEDDING.</h3>

      <h3>No.XXXI. <i>The Small People's Wedding Feast.</i></h3>

      <p>"The small people of the Eulenberg in Saxony would once hold a
      marriage, and for this purpose slipped in, in the night, through
      the keyhole and the window-chinks into the Hall, and came leaping
      down upon the smooth floor, like peas tumbled out upon the
      threshing-floor. The old Count, who slept in the high canopy bed
      in the Hall, awoke, and marvelled at the number of tiny
      companions; one of whom, in the garb of a herald, now approached
      him, and in well-set <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg091" id=
      "pg091">091</a></span>phrase, courteously prayed him to bear part
      in their festivity. 'Yet one thing,' he added, 'we beg of you. Ye
      shall alone be present; none of your court shall be bold to gaze
      upon our mirth&mdash;yea, not so much as with a glance.' The old
      Count answered pleasantly&mdash;'Since ye have once for all waked
      me up, I will e'en make one among you.' Hereupon was a little
      wifikin led up to him, little torch-bearers took their station,
      and a music of crickets struck up. The Count had much ado to save
      losing his little partner in the dance; she capered about so
      nimbly, and ended with whirling him round and round, until hardly
      might he have his breath again. But, in the midst of the jocund
      measure, all stood suddenly still; the music ceased, and the
      whole throng hurried to the cracks in the doors, mouse-holes, and
      hiding-places of all sorts. The newly-married couple only, the
      heralds, and the dancers, looked upward towards an orifice that
      was in the hall ceiling, and there descried the visage of the old
      Countess, who was curiously prying down upon the mirthful doings.
      Herewith they made their obeisance to the Count; and the same
      which had bidden him, again stepping forward, thanked him for his
      hospitality. 'But,' continued he, 'because our pleasure and our
      wedding hath been in such sort interrupted, that yet another eye
      of man hath looked thereon, henceforward shall your house number
      never more than seven Eulenbergs.' Thereupon, they pressed fast
      forth, one upon another. Presently all was quiet, and the old
      Count once again alone in the dark Hall. The curse hath come true
      to this hour, so as ever one of the six living knights of
      Eulenberg hath died ere the seventh was born."</p>

      <h3>THEY JOIN THE EVENING MIRTH.</h3>

      <h3>No. xxxix. <i>The Hill-Manling at the Dance</i>.</h3>

      <p>"Old folks veritable declared, that some years ago, at Glass,
      in Dorf, an hour from the Wunderberg, and an hour from the town
      of Salzburg, a wedding was kept, to which, towards evening, a
      Hill-Manling came out of the Wunderberg. He exhorted all the
      guests to be in honour, gleesome, and merry, and requested leave
      to join the dancers, which was not refused him. He danced
      accordingly, with modest maidens, one and another; evermore,
      three dances with each, and that with a singular featness;
      insomuch that the wedding guests looked on with admiration and
      pleasure. The dance over, he made his thanks, and bestowed upon
      either of the young married people three pieces of money that
      were of an unknown coinage; whereof each was held to be worth
      four kreuzers; and therewithal <i>admonished them to dwell in
      peace and concord, live Christianly, and piously walking, to
      bring up their children in all goodness</i>. These coins they
      should put amongst their money, and constantly remember
      him&mdash;so should they seldom fall into hardship. <i>But they
      must not therewithal grow arrogant, but, of their superfluity,
      succour their neighbours</i>.</p>

      <p>"This Hill-Manling stayed with them into the night, and took
      of every one to drink and to eat what they proffered; but from
      every one only a little. He then paid his courtesy, and desired
      that one of the wedding guests might take him over the river
      Salzbach toward the mountain. Now, there was at the marriage a
      boatman, by name John Standl, who was presently ready, and they
      went down together to the ferry. During the passage, the ferryman
      asked his meed. The Hill-Manling tendered him, in all humility,
      three pennies. The waterman scorned at such mean hire; but the
      Manling gave him for answer&mdash;'He must not vex himself, but
      safely store up the three pennies; for, so doing, he should never
      suffer default of his having&mdash;<i>if only he did restrain
      presumptousness</i>&mdash;at the same time he gave the boatman a
      little pebble, saying the words&mdash;'If thou shalt hang this
      about thy neck, thou shalt not possibly perish in the water.'
      Which was proved in that same year. Finally, <i>he persuaded him
      to a godly and humble manner of life</i>, and went swiftly away."

      <h3>ANOTHER OF THE SAME.</h3>

      <h3>No. CCCVI. <i>The Three Maidens from the Mere.</i></h3>

      <p>"At Epfenbach, nigh Sinzheim, within men's memory, three
      wondrously beautiful damsels, attired in white, visited, with
      every evening, the village spinning-room. They brought along with
      them ever new songs and tunes, and new pretty tales and games.
      Moreover, their distaffs and spindles had something peculiar, and
      no spinster might so finely and nimbly spin the thread. But upon
      the stroke of eleven, they arose; packed up their spinning gear,
      and for no prayers might be moved to delay for an instant more.
      None wist whence they came, nor whither they went. Only they
      called them, The Maidens from the Mere; or, The Sisters of the
      Lake. The lads were glad to see them there, and were taken with
      love of them; but most of all, the schoolmaster's son. He might
      never have enough of hearkening and talking to them, and nothing
      grieved him more than that every night they went so early away.
      The thought suddenly crossed him, and he set the village clock an
      hour back; and, in the evening, with continual talking and
      sporting, not a soul perceived the delay of the hour. When the
      clock struck eleven&mdash;but it was properly twelve&mdash;the
      three damsels arose, put up their distaffs and things, and
      departed. Upon the following morrow, certain persons went by the
      Mere; they heard a wailing, and saw three bloody spots above upon
      the surface of the water. Since that season, the sisters came
      never again to the room. The schoolmaster's son pined, and died
      shortly thereafter."</p>

      <p>"The count was married: but he had beside a secret amour with
      a marvellous beautiful woman, which came weekly to him every
      Monday, into a summer-house in the garden. This commerce remained
      long concealed from his wife. When he withdrew from her side, he
      pretended to her, that he went, by night, into the Forest, to the
      Stand.</p>

      <p>"But when a few years had thus passed, the countess took a
      suspicion, and was minded to learn the right truth. One summer
      morning early, she slipped after him, and came to the summer
      bower. She there saw her husband, sleeping in the arms of a
      wondrous fair female; but because they both slept so sweetly, she
      would not awaken them; but she took her veil <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg093" id="pg093">093</a></span>from her head,
      and spread it over the feet of both, where they lay asleep.</p>

      <p>"When the beautiful paramour awoke, and perceived the veil,
      she gave a loud cry, began pitifully to wail, and
      said:&mdash;</p>

      <p>"'Henceforwards, my beloved, we see one another never more.
      Now must I tarry at a hundred leagues' distance away, and severed
      from thee.'</p>

      <p>"Therewith she did 1eave the count, but presented him first
      with those afore-named three gifts for his three daughters, which
      they should never let go from them.</p>

      <p>"The House of Bassenstein, for long years, had a toll, to draw
      in fruit, from the town of Spinal,<sup>33</sup> whereto this
      Bushel was constantly used."</p>

      <h3>THE HOUSEHOLD SPIRIT DOES HOUSEHOLD SERVICE IN A MILL.</h3>

      <h3>No. LXXIII. <i>The Kobold in the Mill.</i></h3>

      <p>"Two students did once fare afoot from Rintel. They purposed
      putting up for the night in a village; but for as much as there
      did a violent rain fall, and the darkness grew upon them, so as
      they might no further forward, they went up to a near-lying mill,
      knocked, and begged a night's quarters. The miller was, at the
      first, deaf, but yielded, at the last, to their instant entreaty,
      opened the door, and brought them into a room. They were hungry
      and thirsty both; and because there stood upon a table a dish
      with food, and a mug of beer, they begged the miller for them,
      being both ready and willing to pay; but the miller denied
      them&mdash;would not give them even a morsel of bread, and only
      the hard bench for their night's bed.</p>

      <p>"'The meat and the drink,' said he, 'belong to the Household
      Spirit. If ye love your lives, leave them both untouched. But
      else have ye no harm to fear. If there chance a little din in the
      night, be ye but still and sleep.'</p>

      <p>"The two students laid themselves down to sleep; but after the
      space of an hour or the like, hunger did assail the one so
      vehemently that he stood up and sought after the dish. The other,
      a Master of Arts, warned him to leave to the Devil what was the
      Devil's due; but he answered, 'I have a better right than the
      Devil to it'&mdash;seated himself at the table, and ate to his
      heart's content, so that little was left of the cookery. After
      that, he laid hold of the can, took a good Pomeranian pull, and
      having thus somewhat appeased his desire, he laid himself again
      down to his companion; but when, after a time, thirst anew
      tormented him, he again rose up, and pulled a second so hearty
      draught, that he left the Household Spirit only the bottoms.
      After he had thus cheered and comforted himself, he lay down and
      fell asleep.</p>

      <p>"All remained quiet on to midnight; but hardly was this well
      by, when the Kobold came banging in with so loud
      coil,<sup>34</sup> that both sleepers awoke in great fright. He
      bounced a few times to and fro about the room, then seated
      himself as if to enjoy his supper at the table, and they could
      plainly hear how he pulled the dish to him. Immediately he set
      it, as though in ill humour, hard down again, laid hold of the
      can, pressed up the lid, but straightway let it clap sharply to
      again. He now fell to his work; he wiped the table, next the legs
      of the table, carefully down, and then swept, as with a besom,
      the door diligently. When this was done, he returned to visit
      once more the dish and the beercan, if his luck might be any
      better this turn, but once more pushed both angrily away.
      Thereupon he proceeded in his labour, came to the benches,
      washed, scoured, rubbed them, below and above. When he
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg094" id=
      "pg094">094</a></span>came to the place where the two students
      lay, he passed them over, and worked on beyond their feet. When
      this was done, he began upon the bench a second time above their
      heads; and, for the second time likewise, passed over the
      visitants. But the third time, when he came to them, he stroked
      gently the one which had nothing tasted, over the hair and along
      the whole body, without any whit hurting him; but the other he
      griped by the feet, dragged him two or three times round the room
      upon the floor, till at the last he left him lying, and ran
      behind the stove, whence he laughed him loudly to scorn. The
      student crawled back to the bench; but in a quarter of an hour
      the Kobold began his work anew, sweeping, cleaning, wiping. The
      two lay there quaking with fear:&mdash;the one he felt quite
      softly over, when he came to him; but the other he flung again
      upon the ground, and again broke out, at the back of the stove,
      into a flouting horse-laugh.</p>

          set."</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>"The students now no longer chose to lie upon the bench, rose,
      and set up, before the closed and locked door, a loud outcry; but
      none took any heed to it. They were at length resolved to lay
      themselves down close together upon the flat floor; but the
      Kobold left them not in peace. He began, for the third time, his
      game:&mdash;came and lugged the guilty one about, laughed, and
      scoffed him. He was now fairly mad with rage, drew his sword,
      thrust and cut into the corner whence the laugh rang, and
      challenged the Kobold with bravadoes, to come on. He then sat
      down, his weapon in his hand, upon the bench, to await what
      should further befall; but the noise ceased, and all remained
      still.</p>

      <p>"The miller upbraided them upon the morrow, for that they had
      not conformed themselves to his admonishing, neither had left the
      victuals untouched. It was as much as their two lives were
      worth."</p>

      <p>And <i>still</i>, our fuller examples, coming to us wholly

      habitudes of <i>various</i> WIGHTS and ELVES, may furnish, for
      comparison with Ernst Willkomm's Upper Lusatian, an EXTRA
      Lusatian picture of the TEUTONIC FAIRYHOOD.</p>

      <h3>THE FAIRY TUTOR.</h3>

      <p>"In days of yore there lived, alone in her castle, a maiden
      named Swanhilda. She was the only child of a proud father, lately
      deceased. Her mother she had lost when she was but a child; so
      that the education of the daughter had fallen wholly into the
      hands of the father.</p>

      <p>"During the lifetime even of the old knight, many suitors had
      offered themselves for Swanhilda; but she seemed to be insensible
      to every tender emotion, and dismissed with disdainful
      haughtiness the whole body of wooers. Meanwhile she hunted the
      stag and the board, and performed squire's service for her
      gradually declining parent. This manner of life was so entirely
      to the taste of the maiden, notwithstanding that in delicacy of
      frame, and in bewitching gracefulness of figure, she gave place
      to none of her sex, that when at length her father died, she took
      upon herself the management of the castle, and lived aloof in
      pride and independence, in the very fashion of an Amazon. Maugre
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg095" id=
      "pg095">095</a></span>the many refusals which Swanhilda had
      already distributed on every side, there still flocked to her
      loving knights, eager to wed; but, like their predecessors, they
      were all sent drooping home again. The young nobility could at
      last bear this treatment no longer; and they, one and all,
      resolved either to constrain the supercilious damsel to wedlock,
      or to make her smart for a refusal. An embassy was dispatched,
      charged with notifying this resolution to the mistress of the
      castle. Swanhilda heard the speakers quietly to the end; but her
      answer was tuned as before, or indeed rang harsher and more
      offensive than ever. Turning her back upon the embassy, she left
      them to depart, scorned and ashamed.</p>

      <p>"In the night following the day upon which this happened,
      Swanhilda was disturbed out of her sleep by a noise which seemed
      to her to ascend from her chamber floor; but let her strain her
      eyes as she might, she could for a long while discern nothing. At
      length she observed, in the middle of the room, a straying
      sparkle of light, that threw itself over and over like a tumbler,
      tittering, at the same time, like a human being. Swanhilda for a
      while kept herself quiet; but as the luminous antic ceased not
      practising his harlequinade, she peevishly exclaimed&mdash;'What
      buffoon is carrying on his fooleries here? I desire to be left in
      peace.' The light vanished instantly, and Swanhilda already had
      congratulated herself upon gaining her point, when suddenly a
      loud shrilly sound was heard&mdash;the floor of the apartment
      gave way, and from the gap there arose a table set out with the
      choicest viands. It rested upon a lucid body of air, upon which
      the tiny attendants skipped with great agility to and fro,
      waiting upon seated guests. At first Swanhilda was so amazed that
      her breath forsook her; but becoming by degrees somewhat
      collected, she observed, to her extreme astonishment, that an
      effigy of herself sat at the strange table, in the midst of the
      numerous train of suitors, whom she had so haughtily dismissed.
      The attendants presented to the young knights the daintiest
      dishes, the savour of which came sweetly-smelling enough to the
      nostrils of the proud damsel. As often, however, as the knights
      were helped to meat and drink, the figure of Swanhilda at the
      board was presented by an ill-favoured Dwarf, who stood as her
      servant behind her, with an empty basket, whereat the suitor's
      broke out into wild laughter. She also soon became aware, that as
      many courses were served up to the guests as she had heretofore
      dispensed refusals, and the amount of these was certainly not
      small.</p>

      <p>"Swanhilda, weary of the absurd phantasmagoria, was going to
      speak again; but to her horror she discovered that the power of
      speech had left her. She had for some time been struck with a
      kind of whispering and tittering about her. In order to make out
      whence this proceeded, she leaned out of her bed, and, peering
      between the silk curtains, perceived two smart diminutive
      cupbearers, in garments of blue, with green aprons, and small
      yellow caps. She had scarcely got sight of the little gentlemen
      when their whispering took the character of audible words; and
      the dumb Swanhilda was enabled to overhear the following
      discourse:</p>

      <p>"'But, I pri'thee, tell me, Sweetflower, how this show shall
      end?' said one of the two cupbearers,&mdash;'thou art, we know,
      the confidant of our queen, and, certes, canst disclose to me
      somewhat of her plans?'</p>

      <p>"'That can I, my small-witted Monsieur Silverfine,' answered
      Sweetflower. 'Know, therefore, that this sweet and lovely to
      behold brute of a girl, is now beginning to suffer the
      castigation due to her innumerable offences. Swanhilda has sinned
      against all maidenly modesty, has borne herself proud and
      overbearing towards honourable gentlemen, and, besides, has most
      seriously offended our queen.'</p>

      <p>"'How so?' enquired Silverfine.</p>

      <p>"'By storming on her Barbary steed, like the devil himself,
      through the thick of our States' Assembly, pounding the arms and
      legs of I don't know how many of our sapient representatives.
      What makes the matter worse is, that this happened at the very
      opening of the diet, and whilst the grand prelusive symphony of
      the whole hidden people was in full burst. We were sitting by
      hundreds of thousands <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg096" id=
      "pg096">096</a></span>upon blades, stalks, and leaves; some of us
      still actively busied arranging comfortable seats for the older
      people in the blue harebells. For this we had stripped the skins
      of sixty thousand red field spiders, and wrought them into
      canopies and hangings. All our talented performers had tuned
      their instruments, scraped, fluted, twanged, jingled, and shawmed
      to their hearts' content, and had resined their fiddlesticks upon
      the freshest of dewdrops. All at once, tearing out of the wood,
      with your leave, or without your leave, comes this monster of a
      girl, plump upon upper house and lower house together. Ah,
      lack-a-daisy! what a massacre it was! The first hoof struck a
      thousand of our prime orators dead upon the spot, the other three
      hoofs scattered the Imperial diet in all directions, and, what is
      worse than all, tore to pieces a multitude of our exquisite caps.
      Our queen was almost frantic at the breach of the peace&mdash;she
      stamped with her foot, and cried out, "LIGHTNING!" and what that
      means we all pretty well know. Just at this time, too, she
      received information of the maiden's arrogant behaviour towards
      her suitors, and on the instant she determined to put the sinner
      to her prayers. We began by devouring every thing clean up,
      giving her the pleasure of looking on.'</p>

      <p>"'Silly, absurd creatures!' <i>thought</i> Swanhilda, as the
      little butler advanced to the table to put on some fresh wine.
      During his absence she had time to note how perhaps a dozen other
      Fairies drew up through the floor whole pailfuls of wine and
      smoking meats, which were conveyed immediately to the table, and
      there consumed as if by the wind. She was heartily longing for
      the day to dawn, that the sun might dissipate her dream, when the
      sprightly little speaker came to his place again.</p>

      <p>"'Now we can gossip a little longer,' said Sweetflower. 'My
      guests are provided for, and between this and
      cock-crow&mdash;when house and cellar will be
      emptied&mdash;there's some time yet.'</p>

      <p>"Swanhilda uttered (<i>mentally</i>) a prodigious imprecation,
      and turned herself so violently in the bed, that the little
      gentlemen were absolutely terrified.</p>

      <p>"'I verily believe we are going to have an earthquake!' said
      Silverfine.</p>

      <p>"'No such thing!' answered Sweetflower. 'The amiable young
      lady in bed there has seen the sport perhaps, and is very likely
      not altogether pleased with it.'</p>

      <p>"'Don't you think she would speak, if she saw all this
      wastefulness going on?' asked Silverfine.</p>

      <p>"'Yes, if she could!' chuckled Sweetflower. 'But our queen has
      been cruel enough to strike her dumb, whilst she looks upon this
      heartbreaking spectacle. If she once wakes, she won't be troubled
      again with sleep before cock-crow.'</p>

      <p>"'A pretty business!' <i>thought</i> Swanhilda, once more
      tossing herself passionately about in her bed.</p>

      <p>"'Quite right!' said Sweetflower triumphantly. 'The imp of a
      girl has waked up.'</p>

      <p>"'Insolent wretches!' said Swanhilda (internally.) 'Brute and
      imp to me! Oh, if I could only speak!'</p>

      <p>"'Why, the whole fun of the thing is,' said Sweetflower,
      almost bursting with laughter, 'just that that wish won't be
      gratified. Does the fool of a woman think that she is to trample
      down our orchestra with impunity, to put our States' Assembly to
      flight, and to crush our very selves into a jelly!'</p>

      <p>"'And the unbidden guests divine my very thoughts!'
      <i>thought</i> Swanhilda. 'Upon my life, it looks as if a spice
      of omniscience had really crept under their caps!'</p>

      <p>"'Why, of course!' answered Sweetflower.</p>

      <p>"'Then will I think no more!' <i>resolved</i> Swanhilda.</p>

      <p>"'And there, my prudent damsel, you show a good discretion,'
      returned Sweetflower, saluting her with an ironical bow.</p>

      <p>"'How will it be, then, with our caps?' enquired Silverfine.
      'Are they to be repaired?'</p>

      <p>"'Oh, certainly,' returned Sweetflower; 'and that will cost
      our Amazon here more than all. Indeed, the conditions of her
      punishment are, to make good the caps, to pledge her troth to one
      of her despised suitors, to compensate the rest with magnificent
      gifts, and, for the future, never to mount hunter more, but to
      amble upon a gentle palfrey, as a lady should. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg097" id="pg097">097</a></span>And, till all
      this is done, am I to have the teaching of her.'</p>

      <p>"'Pretty conditions truly!' thought Swanhilda. 'I would rather
      die than keep them.'</p>

      <p>"'Just as you please, most worthy madam,' answered
      Sweetflower; 'but you'll think better of it yet, perhaps.'</p>

      <p>"'It will fall heavy enough upon her,' said Silverfine,
      'seeing that we have it in command to seize upon all the lady's
      treasures.'</p>

      <p>"'Capital, capital!' shouted Sweetflower. 'That's peppering
      the punishment truly! For now must this haughty man-hating
      creature go about begging, catching and carrying fish to market,
      and so submitting herself to the scorn and laughter of all her
      former lovers, till her trade makes her rich again. Nothing but
      luck in fishing will our queen vouchsafe the audacious madam.
      Three years are allowed her. But, in the interim, she must starve
      and famish like a white mouse learning to dance.'</p>

      <p>"At this moment a monstrous burst of laughter roared from the
      table. The guests sang aloud&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>"'The last flagon we end,</p>

        <p>Swanhilda shall mend;</p>

        <p>Huzza, knights, and drink</p>

        <p>To the last dollar's chink!'</p>
      </div>

      <p>"As the song ceased, the table descended, the floor closed up,
      and stillness was in the room again, as when the lady had first
      retired to her couch. The cock crew, and Swanhilda fell into a
      deep sleep.</p>
      <hr />

      <p>"When it left her, the sun already shone high and bright, and
      played on her silken bed-curtains. She rubbed her eyes, and
      seeing every thing about her in its usual state, she concluded
      that what had happened was nothing worse than a feverish dream.
      She now arose, began dressing herself, and would have allayed her
      waking thirst, but she could find neither glass nor
      water-pitcher. She called angrily to her waiting-woman.</p>

      <p>"'How come you to forget water, blockhead?' she exclaimed;
      'get some quickly, and then&mdash;Breakfast!'</p>

      <p>"The attendant departed, shaking her head; for she knew well
      enough that every thing had been put in order as usual on the
      evening before. She very quickly returned, frightened out of her
      wits, and hardly able to speak.</p>

      <p>"'Oh my lady! my lady! my lady!' she stammered out.</p>

      <p>"'Well, where is the water?'</p>

      <p>"'Gone! all drained and dried up! Tub, brook, well&mdash;all
      empty and dry!'</p>

      <p>"'Is it possible?' said Swanhilda. 'Your eyes have surely
      deceived you! But never mind&mdash;bring up my breakfast. A ham
      and two Pomeranian geese-breasts.'</p>

      <p>"'Alack! gracious lady!' answered the girl, sobbing, 'every
      thing in the house is gone too! The wine-casks lie in pieces on
      the cellar floor; the stalls are empty; your favourite horse is
      away&mdash;hay and corn rotted through. It is shocking!'</p>

      <p>"Swanhilda dismissed her, and broke out at first into words
      wild and vehement. She checked them; but tears of disappointment
      and bitter rage forced their way in spite of her. A visit to her
      cellar, store-rooms, and granaries, convinced her of the horrible
      transformation which a night had effected in every thing that
      belonged to her. She found nothing every where but mould and
      sickly-smelling mildew; and was too soon aware that the hideous
      images of the night were nothing less than frightful realities.
      Her hardened heart stood proof; and since the whole region for
      leagues round was turned into a blighted brown heath, she at one
      resolved to die of hunger. Ere noon her few servants had deserted
      the castle, and Swanhilda herself hungered till her bowels
      growled again.</p>

      <p>"This laudable self-castigation she persevered in for three
      days long, when her hunger had increased to such a pitch that she
      could no longer remain quiet in the castle. In a state of half
      consciousness, she staggered down to the lake, known far and wide
      by the name of the Castle mere. Here, on the glassy surface,
      basked the liveliest fishes. Swanhilda for a while watched in
      silence the disport of the happy creatures, then snatched up a
      hazel wand lying at her feet, round the end of which a worm had
      coiled, and, half maddened by the joyance of the finny tribe,
      struck with it into the water. A greedy fish snapped at the
      switch. The famishing Swanhilda clutched <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg098" id="pg098">098</a></span>hungeringly at
      it, but found in her hand a piece of offensive carrion, and
      nothing more; whilst around, from every side, there rang such a
      clatter of commingled mockery and laughter, that Swanhilda vented
      a terrible imprecation, and shed once more&mdash;a scorching
      tear.</p>

      <p>"'Oh! we shall soon have you tame enough!' said a voice
      straight before her, and she recognized it at once for the
      speaker of that miserable night. Looking about her, she perceived
      a moss-rose that luxuriated upon the rock. In one of the expanded
      buds sat a little kicking fellow, with green apron, sky-blue
      vest, and yellow bonnet. He was laughing right into the face of
      the angry miss; and, quaffing off one little flower-cup after
      another, filled them bravely again, and jingled with his tiny
      bunch of keys, as if he had been grand butler to the
      universe.</p>

      <p>"'A flavour like a nosegay!' said the malicious rogue. 'Wilt
      hob-nob with me, maiden? What do you say? Are we adepts at
      sacking a house? 'Twill give thee trouble to fill thy cellars
      again as we found them. Take heart, girl. If you will come to,
      and take kindly to your angling, and do the thing that's handsome
      by your wooers, you shall have an eatable dinner yet up at the
      castle.'</p>

      <p>"'Infamous pigmy!' exclaimed Swanhilda, lashing with her rod,
      as she spoke, at the little rose. The small buffeteer meanwhile
      had leaped down, and, in the turning of a hand, had perched
      himself upon the lady's nose, where he drummed an animating march
      with his heels.</p>

      <p>"'Thy nose, I do protest, is excellently soft, thou wicked
      witch!' said the rascal. 'If thou wilt now try thy hand at
      fishing for the town market, thou shalt be entertained the while
      with the finest band of music in the world. Be good and pretty,
      and take up thy angling-rod. Trumpets and drums, flutes and
      clarinets, shall all strike up together.'</p>

      <p>"Swanhilda tried hard to shake the jocular tormentor off, but
      he kept his place on the bridge as if he had grown to it. She
      made a snatch at him, and he bit her finger.</p>

      <p>"'Hark'e, my damsel!' quoth Sweetflower; 'if you are so
      unmannerly, 'tis time for a lesson. You smarted too little when
      you were a young one. We must make all that good now;' and
      forthwith he settled himself properly upon her nose, dangling a
      leg on either side, like a cavalier in saddle. 'Come, my pretty,
      be industrious,' continued he; 'get to work, and follow good
      counsel.' And then he whistled a blithe and gamesome tune.</p>

      <p>"Swanhilda, not heedlessly to prolong her own vexation, dipped
      the rod into the water, and immediately saw another gleaming fish
      wriggling at its end. A basket, delicately woven of flowers,
      stood beside her, half filled with clear water. The fish dropped
      into it of themselves. The wee companion beat meanwhile with his
      feet upon the wings of the lady's nose, played ten instruments or
      more at once, and extemporized a light rambling rhyme, wherein
      arch gibes and playful derision of her present forlorn estate
      were not unmingled with auguries of a friendlier future.</p>

      <p>"'There, you see! where's the distress?' said the urchin,
      laughing. 'The basket is as full as it can hold. Off with you to
      the town, and when your fish are once sold, you may make
      yourself&mdash;some water-gruel.' With these words the elf leaped
      into the fish-basket, crept out again on the other side, plucked
      a king-cup, took seat in it, and gave the word&mdash;'Forwards!'
      The flower, on the instant, displayed its petals. There appeared
      sail and rudder to the small and delicate ship, which at once
      took motion, and sailed gaily through the air.</p>

      <p>"'A prosperous market to you, Swanhilda!' cried Sweetflower,
      'behave discreetly now, and do your tutor justice!'</p>

      <p>"Swanhilda, perforce, resigned herself to her destiny. She
      took her basket, and carried it home, intending to disguise
      herself as completely as possible before making for the town. But
      all her clothes lay crumbling into dust. Needs must she then,
      harassed by hunger and thirst, begin her weary walk, equipped, as
      she was, in her velvet riding-habit.</p>

      <p>"Without fatigue, surprised at her celerity&mdash;she was in
      the market-place. The eyes of all naturally took the direction of
      the well-born fisherwoman. Still pity held the tongue
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg099" id="pg099">099</a></span>of
      scorn in thrall, and Swanhilda saw her basket speedily emptied.
      Once more within her castle walls, she beheld a running spring in
      the courtyard, and near it an earthen pitcher. She
      filled&mdash;drank&mdash;and carried the remainder to the hall,
      where she found a small fire burning, a pipkin, and a loaf. She
      submissively cooked herself a meagre pottage of bread and water,
      appeased the cravings of nature, and fell into a sound sleep.</p>

      <p>"Morning came, and she awoke with thirst burning afresh. She
      hastened to the spring, but fountain and pitcher were no loner
      there. In their stead a hoarse laugh greeted her; and in the next
      instant she perceived the tiny butler, astride upon a cork,
      galloping before her across the courtyard, and addressing his
      pupil with another snatch of his derisive song.</p>

      <p>"The courage of Swanhilda surmounted her wrath, and she
      carried her fish-basket to the lake. It was soon filled, and she
      again on her way to market. An amazing multitude of people were
      already in motion here, who presently thronged about the
      market-woman. The basket was nearly emptied, when two of her old
      suitors approached. Swanhilda was confounded, and a blush of deep
      shame inflamed her countenance. Curiosity and the pleasure of
      malice spurred them to accost her; but the sometime-haughty
      damsel cast her eyes upon the ground, and in answer tendered her
      fish for sale. The knights bought; mixing, however, ungentle
      gibes with their good coin. Swanhilda, at the moment, caught
      sight of her tutor peeping from a daisy&mdash;saluting her with
      his little cap, and nodding approbation.</p>

      <p>"'I would you were in the kingdom of pepper!' thought
      Swanhilda, and in the next instant the fairy was running upon her
      nose and cheeks, most unmercifully stamping, and tickling her
      with a little hair till she sneezed again.</p>

      <p>"'Stay, stay, I must teach thee courtesy, if I can. What! a
      profane swearer too! Wish me in the kingdom of pepper! We'll have
      pepper growing on thy soft cheeks here. There, there&mdash;is
      that pepper? Thou art rouged, my lady, ready for a ball!'</p>

      <p>"Swanhilda turned upon her homeward way, the adhesive Elf
      still tripping ceaselessly about her face, and bore her
      infliction with a virtuous patience. In her court and hall she
      found, as before, the spring, the bread, and the fire. As before,
      she satisfied hunger and thirst, and slept&mdash;the sweeter
      already for her punishment and pain.</p>

      <p>"And so passed day after day. The tricky Elf became a less
      severe, still trusty schoolmaster. The profits of her trading,
      under fairy guardianship, were great to marvelling; and it must
      be owned that her aversion to angling craft did not increase in
      proportion. As time ran on, she had encountered all her discarded
      knights, now singly and now in companies. A year and a half
      elapsed, and left the relation between suitors and maiden as at
      the beginning. At length a chivalric and gentle knight, noble in
      person as in birth, ventured to accost her, loving and reverently
      as in her brighter days of yore. Abashed, overcome with shame,
      the maiden was at the mercy of the light-winged, blithe, and
      watchful god, who seized his hour to enthrone himself upon her
      heart. She bought the fairy caps and mantles&mdash;she made
      honourable satisfaction to the knights, and to him whose generous
      constancy had won her heart, she gave a willing and a softened
      hand.</p>

      <p>"Upon her wedding day, the QUIET PEOPLE did not fail to adorn
      the festival with their radiant presence; albeit the merry
      creatures played a strange cross-game on the occasion. The
      blissful day over, and the happy bride and bridegroom withdrawing
      from the banquet and the dance, the well-pleased chirping, able
      little tutor hopped before them, and led them to the hymeneal
      bower with floral flute, and gratulatory song!" <span class=

      <h2>PORTUGAL.<sup>35</sup></h2>

      <div class="footnote">
        <p>35: <i>Memoirs of the Marquis of Pombal</i>. By J. SMITH,
        Esq., Private Secretary to the Marquis of Saldanha. Two
        vols.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The connexion of Portugal with England has been continued for
      so long a period, and the fortunes of Portugal have risen and
      fallen so constantly in the exact degree of her more intimate or
      more relaxed alliance with England that a knowledge of her
      interests, her habits, and her history, becomes an especial
      accomplishment of the English statesman. The two countries have
      an additional tie, in the similitude of their early pursuits,
      their original character for enterprise, and their mutual
      services. Portugal, like England, with a narrow territory, but
      that territory largely open to the sea, was maritime from her
      beginning; like England, her early power was derived from the
      discovery of remote countries; like England, she threw her force
      into colonization, at an era when all other nations of Europe
      were wasting their strength in unnecessary wars; like England,
      without desiring to enlarge her territory, she has preserved her
      independence; and, so sustain the similitude to its full extent,
      like England, she founded an immense colony in the western world,
      with which, after severing the link of government, she retains
      the link of a common language, policy, literature, and
      religion.</p>

      <p>The growth of the great European powers at length overshadowed
      the prosperity of Portugal, and the usurpation of her government
      by Spain sank her into a temporary depression. But the native
      gallantry of the nation at length shook off the yoke; and a new
      effort commenced for her restoration to the place which she was
      entitled to maintain in the world. It is remarkable that, at such
      periods in the history of nations, some eminent individual comes
      forward, as if designated for the especial office of a national
      guide. Such an individual was the Marquis of Pombal, the virtual
      sovereign of Portugal for twenty-seven years&mdash;a man of
      talent, intrepidity, and virtue. His services were the crush of
      faction and the birth of public spirit, the fall of the Jesuits
      and the peace of his country. His inscription should be, "The
      Restorer of his Country."</p>

      <p>The Marquis of Pombal was born on the 13th of May 1699, at
      Soure, a Portuguese village near the town of Pombal. His father,
      Manoel Carvalho, was a country gentleman of moderate fortune, of
      the rank of <i>fidalgo de provincia</i>&mdash;a distinction which
      gave him the privileges attached to nobility, though not to the
      title of a grandee, that honour not descending below dukes,
      marquises, and counts. His mother was Theresa de Mendonca, a
      woman of family. He had two brothers, Francis and Paul. His own
      names were Sebastian Joseph, to which was added that of Mello,
      from his maternal ancestor.</p>

      <p>Having, like the sons of Portuguese gentlemen in general,
      studied for a period in the university of Coimbra, he entered the
      army as a private, according to the custom of the country, and
      rose to the rank of corporal, which he held until circumstances,
      and an introduction to Cardinal Motta, who was subsequently
      prime-minister, induced him to devote himself to the study of
      history, politics, and law. The cardinal, struck with his
      ability, strongly advised him to persevere in those pursuits,
      appointed him, in 1733, member of the Royal Academy of History,
      and shortly after, the king proposed that he should write the
      history of certain of the Portuguese monarchs; but this design
      was laid aside, and Pombal remained unemployed for six years,
      until, in 1739, he was sent by the cardinal to London, as
      Portuguese minister. He retained his office until 1745; yet it is
      remarkable, and an evidence of the difficulty of acquiring a new
      language, that Pombal, though thus living six active years in the
      country, was never able to acquire the English language. It must,
      however, be recollected, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg101"
      id="pg101">101</a></span>that at this period French was the
      universal language of diplomacy, the language of the court
      circles, and the polished language of all the travelled ranks of
      England. The writings, too, of the French historians, wits, and
      politicians, were the study of every man who pretended to
      good-breeding, and the only study of most; so that, to a
      stranger, the acquisition of the vernacular tongue could be
      scarcely more than a matter of curiosity. Times, however, are
      changed; and the diplomatist who should now come to this country
      without a knowledge of the language, would be despised for his
      ignorance of an essential knowledge, and had better remain at
      home. Soon after his return, he was employed in a negotiation to
      reconcile the courts of Rome and Vienna on an ecclesiastical
      claim. His reputation had already reached Vienna; and it is
      surmised that Maria Theresa, the empress, had desired his
      appointment as ambassador. His embassy was successful. At Vienna,
      Pombal, who was a widower, married the Countess Ernestein Daun,
      by whom he had two sons and three daughters. Pombal was destined
      to be a favourite at courts from his handsome exterior. He was
      above the middle size, finely formed, and with a remarkably
      intellectual countenance; his manners graceful, and his language
      animated and elegant. His reputation at Vienna was so high, that
      on a vacancy in the Foreign office at Lisbon, Pombal was recalled
      to take the portfolio in 1750. Don John, the king, died shortly
      after, and Don Joseph, at the age of thirty-five, ascended the
      throne, appointing Pombal virtually his prime-minister&mdash;a
      rank which he held, unshaken and unrivaled, for the extraordinary
      period of twenty-seven years.</p>

      <p>The six years of unemployed and private life, which the great
      minister had spent in the practical study of his country, were of
      the most memorable service to his future administration. His six
      years' residence in England added practical knowledge to
      theoretical; and with the whole machinery of a free, active, and
      popular government in constant operation before his eyes, he
      returned to take the government of a dilapidated country. The
      power of the priesthood, exercised in the most fearful shape of
      tyranny; the power of the crown, at once feeble and arbitrary;
      the power of opinion, wholly extinguished; and the power of the
      people, perverted into the instrument of their own
      oppression&mdash;were the elements of evil with which the
      minister had to deal; and he dealt with them vigorously,
      sincerely, and successfully.</p>

      <p>The most horrible tribunal of irresponsible power, combined
      with the most remorseless priestcraft, was the Inquisition; for
      it not merely punished men for obeying their own consciences, but
      tried them in defiance of every principle of enquiry. It not only
      made a law contradictory of every other law, but it established a
      tribunal subversive of every mode by which the innocent could be
      defended. It was a murderer on principle. Pombal's first act was
      a bold and noble effort to reduce this tribunal within the limits
      of national safety. By a decree of 1751, it was ordered that
      thenceforth no judicial burnings should take place without the
      consent and approval of the government, taking to itself the
      right of enquiry and examination, and confirming or reversing the
      sentence according to its own judgment. This measure decided at
      once the originality and the boldness of the minister: for it was
      the first effort of the kind in a Popish kingdom; and it was made
      against the whole power of Rome, the restless intrigues of the
      Jesuits, and the inveterate superstition of the people.</p>

      <p>Having achieved this great work of humanity, the minister's
      next attention was directed to the defences of the kingdom. He
      found all the fortresses in a state of decay, he appropriated an
      annual revenue of L.7000 for their reparation; he established a
      national manufactory of gunpowder, it having been previously
      supplied by contract, and being of course supplied of the worst
      quality at the highest rate. He established regulations for the
      fisheries, he broke up iniquitous contracts, he attempted to
      establish a sugar refinery, and directed the attention of the
      people largely to the cultivation of silk. His next reformation
      was that of the police. The disorders of the late reign had
      covered the highways with robbers. Pombal instituted a police so
      effective, and proceeded <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg102"
      id="pg102">102</a></span>with such determined justice against all
      disturbers of the peace, that the roads grew suddenly safe, and
      the streets of Lisbon became proverbial for security, at a time
      when every capital of Europe was infested with robbers and
      assassins, and when even the state of London was so hazardous, as
      to be mentioned in the king's speech in 1753 as a scandal to the
      country. The next reform was in the collection of the revenue. An
      immense portion of the taxes had hitherto gone into the pockets
      of the collectors. Pombal appointed twenty-eight receivers for
      the various provinces, abolished at a stroke a host of inferior
      officers, made the promisers responsible for the receivers, and
      restored the revenue to a healthy condition. Commerce next
      engaged his attention; he established a company to trade to the
      East and China, the old sources of Portuguese wealth. In the
      western dominions of Portugal, commerce had hitherto languished.
      He established a great company for the Brazil trade. But his
      still higher praise was his humanity. Though acting in the midst
      of a nation overrun with the most violent follies and prejudices
      of Popery, he laboured to correct the abuses of the convents;
      and, among the rest, their habit of retaining as nuns the
      daughters of the Brazilian Portuguese who had been sent over for
      their education. By a wise and humane decree, issued in 1765, the
      Indians, and a large portion of Brazil, were declared free.
      Expedients were adopted to civilize them, and privileges were
      granted to the Portuguese who should contract marriage among
      them. Of course those great objects were not achieved without
      encountering serious difficulties. The pride of the idle
      aristocracy, the sleepless intriguing of the Jesuits, the
      ignorant enthusiasm of the people, and the sluggish supremacy of
      the priests, were all up in arms against him. But his principle
      was pure, his knowledge sound, and his resolution decided. Above
      all, he had, in the person of the king, a man of strong mind,
      convinced of the necessities of change, and determined to sustain
      the minister. The reforms soon vindicated themselves by the
      public prosperity; and Pombal exercised all the powers of a
      despotic sovereign, in the benevolent spirit of a regenerator of
      his country.</p>

      <p>But a tremendous physical calamity was now about to put to the
      test at once the fortitude of this great minister, and the
      resources of Portugal.</p>

      <p>On the morning of All-Saints' day, the 1st of November 1755,
      Lisbon was almost torn up from the foundations by the most
      terrible earthquake on European record. As it was a high Romish
      festival, the population were crowding to the churches, which
      were lighted up in honour of the day. About a quarter before ten
      the first shock was felt, which lasted the extraordinary length
      of six or seven minutes; then followed an interval of about five
      minutes, after which the shock was renewed, lasting about three
      minutes. The concussions were so violent in both instances that
      nearly all the solid buildings were dashed to the ground, and the
      principal part of the city almost wholly ruined. The terror of
      the population, rushing through the falling streets, gathered in
      the churches, or madly attempting to escape into the fields, may
      be imagined; but the whole scene of horror, death, and ruin,
      exceeds all description. The ground split into chasms, into which
      the people were plunged in their fright. Crowds fled to the
      water; but the Tagus, agitated like the land, suddenly rose to an
      extraordinary height, burst upon the land, and swept away all
      within its reach. It was said to have risen to the height of
      five-and-twenty or thirty feet above its usual level, and to have
      sunk again as much below it. And this phenomenon occurred four
      times.</p>

      <p>The despatch from the British consul stated, that the especial
      force of the earthquake seemed to be directly under the city; for
      while Lisbon was lifted from the ground, as if by the explosion
      of a gunpowder mine, the damage either above or below was not so
      considerable. One of the principal quays, to which it was said
      that many people had crowded for safety, was plunged under the
      Tagus, and totally disappeared. Ships were carried down by the
      shock on the river, dashes to pieces against each other, or flung
      upon the shore. To <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg103" id=
      "pg103">103</a></span>complete the catastrophe, fires broke out
      in the ruins, which spread over the face of the city, burned for
      five or six days, and reduced all the goods and property of the
      people to ashes. For forty days the shocks continued with more or
      less violence, but they had now nothing left to destroy. The
      people were thus kept in a constant state of alarm, and forced to
      encamp in the open fields, though it was now winter. The royal
      family were encamped in the gardens of the palace; and, as in all
      the elements of society had been shaken together, Lisbon and its
      vicinity became the place of gathering for banditti from all
      quarters in the kingdom. A number of Spanish deserters made their
      way to the city, and robberies and murders of the most desperate
      kind were constantly perpetrated.</p>

      <p>During this awful period, the whole weight of government fell
      upon the shoulders of the minister; and he bore it well. He
      adopted the most active measures for provisioning the city, for
      repressing plunder and violence, and for enabling the population
      to support themselves during this period of suffering. It was
      calculated that seven millions sterling could scarcely repair the
      damage of the city; and that not less than eighty thousand lives
      had been lost, either crushed by the earth or swallowed up by the
      waters. Some conception of the native mortality may be formed
      from that of the English: of the comparatively small number of
      whom, resident at that time in Lisbon, no less than twenty-eight
      men and fifty women were among the sufferers.</p>

      <p>The royal family were at the palace of Belem when this
      tremendous calamity occurred. Pombal instantly hastened there. He
      found every one in consternation. "What is to be done," exclaimed
      the king, as he entered "to meet this infliction of divine
      justice?" The calm and resolute answer of Pombal was&mdash;"Bury
      the dead, and feed the living." This sentence is still recorded,
      with honour, in the memory of Portugal.</p>

      <p>The minister then threw himself into his carriage, and
      returned to the ruins. For several days his only habitation was
      his carriage; and from it he continued to issue regulations for
      the public security. Those regulations amounted to the remarkable
      number of two hundred; and embraced all the topics of police,
      provisions, and the burial of the sufferers. Among those
      regulations was the singular, but sagacious one, of prohibiting
      all persons from leaving the city without a passport. By this,
      those who had robbed the people, or plundered the church plate,
      were prevented from escaping to the country and hiding their
      plunder, and consequently were obliged to abandon, or to restore
      it. But every shape of public duty was met by this vigorous and
      intelligent minister. He provided for the cure of the wounded,
      the habitancy of the houseless, the provision of the destitute.
      He brought troops from the provinces for the protection of the
      capital, he forced the idlers to work, he collected the inmates
      of the ruined religious houses, he removed the ruins of the
      streets, buried the dead, and restored the services of the
      national religion.</p>

      <p>Another task subsequently awaited him&mdash;the rebuilding of
      the city. He began boldly; and all that Lisbon now has of beauty
      is due to the taste and energy of Pombal. He built noble squares.
      He did more: he built the more important fabric of public sewers
      in the new streets, and he laid out a public garden for the
      popular recreation. But he found, as Wren found, even in England,
      the infinite difficulty of opposing private interest, even in
      public objects; and Lisbon lost the opportunity of being the most
      picturesque and stately of European cities. One project, which
      would have been at once of the highest beauty and of the highest
      benefit&mdash;a terrace along the shore of the Tagus from Santa
      Apollonia to Belem, a distance of nearly six miles, which would
      have formed the finest promenade in the world&mdash;he was either
      forced to give up or to delay, until its execution was hopeless.
      It was never even begun.</p>

      <p>The vigour of Pombal's administration raised bitter enemies to
      him among those who had lived on the abuses of government, or the
      plunder of the people. The Jesuits hated alike the king and his
      minister. They even declared the earthquake to have <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg104" id="pg104">104</a></span>been a divine
      judgment for the sins of the administration. But they were rash
      enough, in the intemperance of their zeal, to threaten a
      repetition of the earthquake at the same time next year. When the
      destined day came, Pombal planted strong guards at the city
      gates, to prevent the panic of the people in rushing into the
      country. The earthquake did not fulfil the promise; and the
      people first laughed at themselves, and then at the Jesuits. The
      laugh had important results in time.</p>

      <p>There are few things more remarkable in diplomatic history,
      than the long connexion of Portugal with England. It arose
      naturally from the commerce of the two nations&mdash;Portugal,
      already the most adventurous of nations, and England, growing in
      commercial enterprise. The advantages were mutual. In the year
      1367, we have a Portuguese treaty stipulating for protection to
      the Portuguese traders in England. In 1382, a royal order of
      Richard II. permits the Portuguese ambassador to bring his
      baggage into England free of duty&mdash;perhaps one of the
      earliest instances of a custom which marked the progress of
      civilization, and which has since been generally adopted
      throughout all civilized nations. A decree of Henry IV., in 1405,
      exonerates the Portuguese resident in England, and their ships,
      from being made responsible for the debts contracted by their
      ambassadors. In 1656, the important privilege was conceded to the
      English in Portugal, of being exempted from the native
      jurisdiction, and being tried by a judge appointed by England.
      This, in our days, might be an inadmissible privilege; but two
      centuries ago, in the disturbed condition of the Portuguese laws
      and general society, it might have been necessary for the simple
      protection of the strangers.</p>

      <p>The theories of domestic manufactures and free trade have
      lately occupied so large a portion of public interest, that it is
      curious to see in what light they were regarded by a statesman so
      far in advance of his age as Pombal. The minister's theory is in
      striking contradiction to his practice. He evidently approved of
      monopoly and prohibitions, but he exercised neither the one nor
      the other&mdash;nature and necessity were too strong against him.
      We are, however, to recollect, that the language of complaint was
      popular in Portugal, as it always will be in a poor country, and
      that the minister who would be popular must adopt the language of
      complaint. In an eloquent and almost impassioned memoir by
      Pombal, he mourns over the poverty of his country, and hastily
      imputes it to the predominance of English commerce. He tells us
      that, in the middle of the eighteenth century, Portugal scarcely
      produced any thing towards her own support. Two thirds of her
      physical necessities were supplied from England. He complains
      that England had become mistress of the entire commerce of
      Portugal, and in fact that the Portuguese trade was only an
      English trade; that the English were the furnishers and retailers
      of all the necessaries of life throughout the country, and that
      the Portuguese had nothing to do but look on; that Cromwell, by
      the treaty which allowed the supply of Portugal with English
      cloths to the amount of two million sterling, had utterly
      impoverished the country; and in short, that the weakness and
      incapacity of Portugal, as an European state, were wholly owing,
      to her being destitute of trade, and that the destitution was
      wholly owing to her being overwhelmed by English commodities.</p>

      <p>We are not about to enter into detail upon this subject, but
      it is to be remembered, that Portugal obtained the cloth, even if
      she paid for it, cheaper from England than she could have done
      from any other country in Europe; that she had no means of making
      the cloth for herself, and that, after all, man must be clothed.
      Portugal, without flocks or fire, without coals or capital, could
      never have manufactured cloth enough to cover the tenth part of
      her population, at ten times the expense. This has occurred in
      later days, and in more opulent countries. We remember, in the
      reign of the Emperor Paul, when he was frantic enough to declare
      war against England, a pair of broadcloth pantaloons costing
      seven guineas in St Peterburg. This would have been severe work
      for the purse of a Portuguese peasant a hundred years ago. The
      plain fact of domestic manufactures being this, that no folly can
      be <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg105" id=
      "pg105">105</a></span>more foolish than to attempt to form them
      where the means and the country do not give them a natural
      superiority. For example, coals and iron are essential to the
      product of all works in metal. France has neither. How can she,
      therefore, contest the superiority of our hardware? She contests
      it simply by doing without it, and by putting up with the most
      intolerable cutlery that the world has ever seen. If, where
      manufactures are already established, however ineffectual, it may
      become a question with the government whether some privations
      must not be submitted to by the people in general, rather than
      precipitate those unlucky manufactures into ruin; there can be no
      question whatever on the subject where manufactures have not been
      hitherto established. Let the people go to the best market, let
      no attempt be made to force nature, and let no money be wasted on
      the worst article got by the worst means. One thing, however, is
      quite clear with respect to Portugal, that, by the English
      alliance, she has gained what is worth all the manufactures of
      Europe&mdash;independence. When, in 1640, she threw off the
      Spanish usurpation, and placed the Braganza family on the
      national throne, she threw herself on the protection of England;
      and that protection never has failed her to this hour. In the
      Spanish invasion of Portugal in 1762, England sent her ten
      thousand men, and the first officer of his day, Count La Lippe,
      who, notwithstanding his German name, was an Englishman born, and
      had commenced his service in the Guards. The Spaniards were
      beaten in all directions, and Portugal was included in the treaty
      of Fontainbleau in 1763. The deliverance of Portugal in the
      Peninsular war is too recent to be forgotten, and too memorable
      to be spoken of here as it deserves. And to understand the full
      value of this assistance, we are to recollect, that Portugal is
      one of the smallest kingdoms of Europe, and at the same time the
      most exposed; that its whole land frontier is open to Spain, and
      its whole sea frontier is open to France; that its chief produce
      is wine and oranges, and that England is incomparably its best
      customer for both.</p>

      <p>Pombal, in his memoir, imputes a portion of the poverty of
      Portugal to her possession of the gold mines of Brazil. This is
      one of the paradoxes of the last century; but nations are only
      aggregates of men, and what makes an individual rich, cannot make
      a nation poor. The true secret is this&mdash;that while the
      possession of the gold mines induced an indolent government to
      rely upon them for the expenses of the state, that reliance led
      them to abandon sources of profit in the agriculture and commerce
      of the country, which were of ten times the value. This was
      equally the case in Spain. The first influx from the mines of
      Peru, enabled the government to disregard the revenues arising
      from the industry of the people. In consequence of the want of
      encouragement from the government, the agriculture and commerce
      of Spain sank rapidly into the lowest condition, whilst the
      government indolently lived on the produce of the mines. But the
      more gold and silver exist in circulation, the less becomes their
      value. Within half a century, the imports from the Spanish and
      Portuguese mines, had reduced the value of the precious metals by
      one half; and those imports thus became inadequate to the
      ordinary expenses of government. Greater efforts were then made
      to obtain them from the mines. Still, as the more that was
      obtained the less was the general value, the operation became
      more profitless still; and at length both Spain and Portugal were
      reduced to borrow money, which they had no means to pay&mdash;in
      other words, were bankrupt. And this is the true solution of the
      problem&mdash;why have the gold and silver mines of the Peninsula
      left them the poorest nations of Europe? Yet this was contrary to
      the operation of new wealth. The discovery of the mines of the
      New World appears to have been a part of that providential plan,
      by which a general impulse was communicated to Europe in the
      fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Europe was preparing for a new
      vigour of religion, politics, commerce, and civilization. Nothing
      stimulates national effort of every kind with so much power and
      rapidity, as a new general accession of wealth, or, as the
      political economist would pronounce it, a rise of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg106" id="pg106">106</a></span>wages, whether
      industrial or intellectual; and this rise was effected by the new
      influx of the mines. If Peru and Mexico had belonged to England,
      she would have converted their treasures into new canals and
      high-roads, new harbours, new encouragements to agriculture, new
      excitements to public education, new enterprises of commerce, or
      the colonization of new countries in the productive regions of
      the globe; and thus she would at once have increased her natural
      opulence, and saved herself from suffering under the depreciation
      of the precious metals, or more partially, by her active
      employment of them, have almost wholly prevented that
      depreciation. But the Peninsula, relying wholly on its imported
      wealth, and neglecting its infinitely more important national
      riches, was exactly in the condition of an individual, who spends
      the principal of his property, which is continually sinking until
      it is extinguished altogether.</p>

      <p>Another source of Peninsular poverty existed in its religion.
      The perpetual holidays of Popery made even the working portion of
      the people habitually idle. Where labour is prohibited for nearly
      a fourth of the year by the intervention of holidays, and thus
      idleness is turned into a sacred merit, the nation must prepare
      for beggary. But Popery goes further still. The establishment of
      huge communities of sanctified idlers, monks and nuns by the ten
      thousand, in every province and almost in every town, gave a
      sacred sanction to idleness&mdash;gave a means of escaping work
      to all who preferred the lounging and useless life of the convent
      to regular labour, and even provided the means of living to
      multitudes of vagabonds, who were content to eat their bread, and
      drink their soup, daily at the convent gates, rather than to make
      any honest decent effort to maintain themselves. Every country
      must be poor in which a large portion of the public property goes
      to the unproductive classes. The soldiery, the monks, the state
      annuitants, the crowds of domestics, dependent on the families of
      the grandees, all are necessarily unproductive. The money which
      they receive is simply consumed. It makes no return. Thus poverty
      became universal; and nothing but the singular fertility of the
      peopled districts of Spain and Portugal, and the fortune of
      having a climate which requires but few of the comforts essential
      in a severer temperature, could have saved them both from being
      the most pauperized of all nations, or even from perishing
      altogether, and leaving the land a desert behind them. It
      strangely illustrates these positions, that, in 1754, the
      Portuguese treasury was so utterly emptied, that the monarch was
      compelled to borrow 400,000 crusadoes (L.40,000) from a private
      company, for the common expenses of his court.</p>

      <p>Wholly and justly disclaiming the imputation which would
      pronounce Portugal a dependent on England, it is impossible to
      turn a page of her history without seeing the measureless
      importance of her English connexion. Every genuine source of her
      power and opulence has either originated with, or been sustained
      by, her great ally. Among the first of these has been the wine
      trade. In the year 1756&mdash;the year following that tremendous
      calamity which had sunk Lisbon into ruins&mdash;the wine-growers
      in the three provinces of Beira, Minho, and Tras-os-Montes,
      represented that they were on the verge of ruin. The adulteration
      of the Portuguese wines by the low traders had destroyed their
      character in Europe, and the object of the representation was to
      reinstate that character. Pombal immediately took up their cause;
      and, in the course of the same year, was formed the celebrated
      Oporto Wine Company, with a capital of £120,000. The declared
      principles of the establishment were, to preserve the quality of
      the wines, to secure the growers by fixing a regular price, and
      to protect them from the combinations of dealers. The company had
      the privilege of purchasing all the wines grown within a
      particular district at a fixed price, for a certain period after
      the vintage. When that period had expired, the growers were at
      liberty to sell the wines which remained unpurchased in whatever
      market they pleased. Monopolies, in the advanced and prosperous
      career of commercial countries, generally sink into abuse; but
      they are, in most instances, absolutely <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg107" id="pg107">107</a></span>necessary to
      the infant growth of national traffic. All the commerce of Europe
      has commenced by companies. In the early state of European trade,
      individuals were too poor for those large enterprises which
      require a large outlay, and whose prospects, however promising,
      are distant. What one cannot do, must be done by a combination of
      many, if it is to be done at all. Though when individual capital,
      by the very action of that monopoly, becomes powerful enough for
      those enterprises, then the time is at hand when the combination
      may be dissolved with impunity. The Oporto Wine Company had no
      sooner come into existence, than its benefits were felt in every
      branch of Portuguese revenue. It restored and extended the
      cultivation of the vine, which is the staple of Portugal. It has
      been abolished in the revolutionary changes of late years. But
      the question, whether the country is yet fit to bear the
      abolition, is settled by the fact, that the wine-growers are
      complaining of ruin, and that the necessity of the case is now
      urging the formation of the company once more.</p>

      <p>The decision of Pombal's character was never more strongly
      shown than on this occasion. The traders into whose hands the
      Portuguese wines had fallen, and who had enjoyed an illegal
      monopoly for so many years, raised tumults, and serious
      insurrection was threatened. At Oporto, the mob plundered the
      director's house, and seized on the chief magistrate. The
      military were attacked, and the government was endangered. The
      minister instantly ordered fresh troops to Oporto; arrests took
      place; seventeen persons were executed; five-and-twenty sent to
      the galleys; eighty-six banished, and others subjected to various
      periods of imprisonment. The riots were extinguished. In a
      striking memoir, written by Pombal after his retirement from
      office, he gives a brief statement of the origin of this
      company&mdash;a topic at all times interesting to the English
      public, and which is about to derive a new interest from its
      practical revival in Portugal. We quote a fragment.</p>

      <p>"The unceasing and urgent works which the calamitous
      earthquake of November 1st, 1755, had rendered indispensable,
      were still vigorously pursued, when, in the following year, one
      Mestre Frei Joao de Mansilla presented himself at the Giunta at
      Belem, on the part of the principal husbandmen of Upper Douro,
      and of the respectable inhabitants of Oporto, in a state of utter
      consternation.</p>

      <p>"In the popular outcry of the time, the English were
      represented as making themselves the sole managers of every
      thing. The fact being, that, as they were the only men who had
      any money, they were almost the sole purchasers in the Portuguese
      markets. But the English here complained of were the low
      traffickers, who, in conjunction with the Lisbon and Oporto
      vintners, bought and managed the wines at their discretion. It
      was represented to the king, that, by those means, the price of
      wine had been reduced to 7200 rios a pipe, or less, until the
      expense of cultivation was more than the value of the produce;
      that those purchasers required one or two years' credit; that the
      price did not pay for the hoeing of the land, which was
      consequently deserted; that all the principal families of one
      district had been reduced to poverty, so much so as to be obliged
      to sell their knives and forks; that the poor people had not a
      drop of oil for their salad, so that they were obliged, even in
      Lent, to season their vegetables with the fat of hogs." The
      memoir mentions even gross vice as a consequence of their extreme
      poverty.</p>

      <p>We quote this passage to show to what extremities a people may
      be reduced by individual mismanagement, and what important
      changes may be produced by the activity of an intelligent
      directing power. The king's letters-patent of 1756, establishing
      the company, provided at once for the purity of the wine, its
      extended sale in England, and the solvency of the wine provinces.
      It is only one among a thousand instances of the hazards in which
      Popery involves all regular government, to find the Jesuits
      inflaming the populace against this most salutary and successful
      act of the king. At confession, they prompted the people to
      believe "that the wines of the company were not fit for the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg108" id=
      "pg108">108</a></span>celebration of mass." (For the priests
      drink wine in the communion, though the people receive only the
      bread.) To give practical example to their precept, they
      dispersed narratives of a great popular insurrection which had
      occurred in 1661; and both incentives resulted in the riots in
      Oporto, which it required all the vigour of Pombal to put
      down.</p>

      <p>But the country and Europe was now to acknowledge the services
      of the great minister on a still higher scale. The extinction of
      the Jesuits was the work of his bold and sagacious mind. The
      history of this event is among the most memorable features of a
      century finishing with the fall of the French monarchy.</p>

      <p>The passion of Rome for territory has been always conspicuous,
      and always unsuccessful. Perpetually disturbing the Italian
      princes in the projects of usurpation, it has scarcely ever
      advanced beyond the original bounds fixed for it by Charlemagne.
      Its spirit of intrigue, transfused into its most powerful order
      the Jesuits, was employed for the similar purpose of acquiring
      territorial dominion. But Europe was already divided among
      powerful nations. Those nations were governed by jealous
      authorities, powerful kings for their leaders, and powerful
      armies for their defence. All was full; there was no room for the
      contention of a tribe of ecclesiastics, although the most daring,
      subtle, and unscrupulous of the countless slaves and soldiers of
      Rome. The world of America was open. There a mighty power might
      grow up unseen by the eye of Europe. A population of unlimited
      multitudes might find space in the vast plains; commerce in the
      endless rivers; defence in the chains of mountains; and wealth in
      the rocks and sands of a region teeming with the precious metals.
      The enterprise was commenced under the pretext of converting the
      Indians of Paraguay. Within a few years the Jesuits formed an
      independent republic, numbering thirty-one towns, with a
      population of a hundred thousand souls. To render their power
      complete, they prohibited all communication between the natives
      and the Spaniards and Portuguese, forbidding them to learn the
      language of either country, and implanting in the mind of the
      Indians an implacable hatred of both Spain and Portugal. At
      length both courts became alarmed, and orders were sent out to
      extinguish the usurpation. Negotiations were in the mean time
      opened between Spain and Portugal relative to an exchange of
      territory, and troops were ordered to effect the exchange.
      Measures of this rank were unexpected by the Jesuits. They had
      reckoned upon the proverbial tardiness of the Peninsular
      councils; but they were determined not to relinquish their prize
      without a struggle. They accordingly armed the natives, and
      prepared for a civil war.</p>

      <p>The Indians, unwarlike as they have always been, now headed by
      their Jesuit captains, outmanoeuvred the invaders. The expedition
      failed; and the baffled invasion ended in a disgraceful treaty.
      The expedition was renewed in the next year, 1755, and again
      baffled. The Portuguese government of the Brazils now made
      renewed efforts, and in 1756 obtained some advantages; but they
      were still as far as ever from final success, and the war,
      fruitless as it was, had begun to drain heavily the finances of
      the mother country. It had already cost the treasury of Lisbon a
      sum equal to three millions sterling. But the minister at the
      head of the Portuguese government was of a different character
      from the race who had, for the last hundred years, wielded the
      ministerial sceptres of Spain and Portugal. His clear and daring
      spirit at once saw where the evil lay, and defied the
      difficulties that lay between him and its cure. He determined to
      extinguish the order of the Jesuits at a blow. The boldness of
      this determination can be estimated only by a knowledge of the
      time. In the middle of the eighteenth century, the Jesuits were
      the ecclesiastical masters of Europe. They were the confessors of
      the chief monarchs of the Continent; the heads of the chief
      seminaries for national education; the principal professors in
      all the universities;&mdash;and this influence, vast as it was by
      its extent and variety, was rendered more powerful by the strict
      discipline, the unhesitating obedience, and the systematic
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg109" id=
      "pg109">109</a></span>activity of their order. All the Jesuits
      existing acknowledged one head, the general of their order, whose
      constant residence was at Rome. But their influence, powerful as
      it was by their open operation on society, derived perhaps a
      superior power from its secret exertions. Its name was
      legion&mdash;its numbers amounted to thousands&mdash;it took
      every shape of society, from the highest to the lowest. It was
      the noble and the peasant&mdash;the man of learning and the man
      of trade&mdash;the lawyer and the monk&mdash;the soldier and the
      sailor&mdash;nay, it was said, that such was the extraordinary
      pliancy of its principle of disguise, the Jesuit was suffered to
      assume the tenets of Protestantism, and even to act as a
      Protestant pastor, for the purpose of more complete deception.
      The good of the church was the plea which purified all imposture;
      the power of Rome was the principle on which this tremendous
      system of artifice was constructed; and the reduction of all
      modes of human opinion to the one sullen superstition of the
      Vatican, was the triumph for which those armies of subtle
      enthusiasm and fraudulent sanctity were prepared to live and
      die.</p>

      <p>The first act of Pombal was to remove the king's confessor,
      the Jesuit Moreira. The education of the younger branches of the
      royal family was in the hands of Jesuits. Pombal procured a royal
      order that no Jesuit should approach the court, without obtaining
      the express permission of the king. He lost no time in repeating
      the assault. Within a month, on the 8th of October 1767, he sent
      instructions to the Portuguese ambassador at Rome, to demand a
      private audience, and lay before the pope the misdemeanours of
      the order.</p>

      <p>Those instructions charged the Jesuits with the most atrocious
      personal profligacy, with a design to master all public power, to
      gather opulence dangerous to the state, and actually to plot
      against the authority of the crowns of Europe. He announced, that
      the king of Portugal had commanded all the Jesuit confessors of
      the prince and princesses to withdraw to their own convents; and
      this important manifesto closed by soliciting the interposition
      of the papal see to prevent the ruin, by purifying an order which
      had given scandal to Christianity, by offences against the public
      and private peace of society, equally unexampled, habitual, and
      abominable. In 1758, the representation to the pope was renewed,
      with additional proofs that the order had determined to usurp
      every function, and thwart every act of the civil government;
      that the confessors of the royal family, though dismissed,
      continued to conspire; that they resisted the formation of royal
      institutions for the renewal of the national commerce; and that
      they excited the people to dangerous tumults, in defiance of the
      royal authority.</p>

      <p>Their intrigues comprehended every object by which influence
      was to be obtained, or money was to be made. The "Great Wine
      Company," on which the chief commerce of Portugal, and almost the
      existence of its northern provinces depended, was a peculiar
      object of their hostility, for reasons which we can scarcely
      apprehend, except they were general jealousy of all lay power,
      and hostility to all the works of Pombal. They assailed it from
      their pulpits; and one of their popular preachers made himself
      conspicuous by impiously exclaiming, "that whoever joined that
      company, would have no part in the company of Jesus Christ."</p>

      <p>The intrigues of this dangerous and powerful society had long
      before been represented to the popes, and had drawn down upon
      them those remonstrances by which the habitual dexterity of Rome
      at once saves appearances, and suffers the continuance of the
      delinquency. The Jesuits were too useful to be restrained; yet
      their crimes were too palpable to be passed over. In consequence,
      the complaints of the monarchs of Spain and Portugal were
      answered by bulls issued from time to time, equally formal and
      ineffective. Yet even from these documents may be ascertained the
      singularly gross, worldly, and illegitimate pursuits of an order,
      professing itself to be supremely religious, and the prime
      sustainer of the "faith of the gospel." The bull of Benedict the
      XIV., issued in 1741, prohibited from "trade and commerce, all
      worldly dominion, and the <i>purchase</i> and <i>sale</i>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg110" id="pg110">110</a></span>of
      converted Indians." The bull extended the prohibition generally
      to the monkish orders, to avoid branding the Jesuits especially.
      But a bull of more direct reprehension was published at the close
      of the year, expressly against the Jesuits in their missions in
      the east and west. The language of this document amounts to a
      catalogue of the most atrocious offences against society,
      humanity, and morals. By this bull, "all men, and especially
      <i>Jesuits</i>," are prohibited, under penalty of
      excommunication, from "making slaves of the Indians; from selling
      and bartering them; from separating them from their wives and
      children; from robbing them of their property; from transporting
      them from their native soil," &amp;c.</p>

      <p>Nothing but the strongest necessity, and the most ample
      evidence, would ever have drawn this condemnation from Rome,
      whether sincere or insincere. But the urgencies of the case
      became more evident from day to day. In 1758, the condemnation
      was followed by the practical measure of appointing Cardinal
      Saldanha visitor and reformer of the Jesuits in Portugal, and the
      Portuguese settlements in the east and west.</p>

      <p>Within two months of this appointment the following decree was
      issued:&mdash;"For just reasons known to us, and which concern
      especially the service of God and the public welfare, we suspend
      from the power of confessing and preaching, in the whole extent
      of our patriarchate, the fathers of the Society of Jesus, from
      this moment, and until further notice." Saldanha had been just
      raised to the patriarchate.</p>

      <p>We have given some observations on this subject, from its
      peculiar importance to the British empire at this moment. The
      order of the Jesuits, extinguished in the middle of the last
      century by the unanimous demand of Europe, charged with every
      crime which could make a great association obnoxious to mankind,
      and exhibiting the most atrocious violations of the common rules
      of human morality, has, within this last quarter of a century,
      been revived by the papacy, with the express declaration, that
      its revival is for the exclusive purpose of giving new effect to
      the doctrines, the discipline, and the power of Rome. The law
      which forbids the admission of Jesuits into England, has shared
      the fate of all laws feebly administered; and Jesuits are active
      by hundreds or by thousands in every portion of the empire. They
      have restored the whole original system, sustained by all their
      habitual passion for power, and urging their way, with all their
      ancient subtlety, through all ranks of Protestantism.</p>

      <p>The courage and intelligence of Pombal placed him in the
      foremost rank of Europe, when the demand was the boldest and most
      essential service which a great minister could offer to his
      country; he broke the power of Jesuitism. But an order so
      numerous&mdash;for even within the life of its half-frenzied
      founder it amounted to 19,000&mdash;so vindictive, and flung from
      so lofty a rank of influence, could not perish without some
      desperate attempts to revenge its ruin. The life of Pombal was so
      constantly in danger, that the king actually assigned him a body
      guard. But the king himself was exposed to one of the most
      remarkable plots of regicide on record&mdash;the memorable Aveiro
      and Tavora conspiracy.</p>

      <p>On the night of the 3d of September 1758, as the king was
      returning to the palace at night in a cabriolet, attended only by
      his valet, two men on horseback, and armed with blunderbusses,
      rode up to the carriage, and leveled their weapons at the
      monarch. One of them missed fire, the other failed of its effect.
      The royal postilion, in alarm, rushed forward, when two men,
      similarly waiting in the road, galloped after the carriage, and
      both fired their blunderbusses into it behind. The cabriolet was
      riddled with slugs, and the king was wounded in several places.
      By an extraordinary presence of mind, Don Joseph, instead of
      ordering the postilion to gallop onward, directed him instantly
      to turn back, and, to avoid alarming the palace, carry him direct
      to the house of the court surgeon. By this fortunate order, he
      escaped the other groups of the conspirators, who were stationed
      further on the road, and under whose repeated discharges he would
      probably have fallen. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg111" id=
      "pg111">111</a></span> The public alarm and indignation on the
      knowledge of this desperate atrocity were unbounded. There seemed
      to be but one man in the kingdom who preserved his composure, and
      that one was Pombal. Exhibiting scarcely even the natural
      perturbation at an event which had threatened almost a national
      convulsion, he suffered the whole to become a matter of doubt,
      and allowed the king's retirement from the public eye to be
      considered as merely the effect of accident. The public despatch
      of Mr Hay, the British envoy at Lisbon, alludes to it, chiefly as
      assigning a reason for the delay of a court mourning&mdash;the
      order for this etiquette, on the death of the Spanish queen, not
      having been put in execution. The envoy mentions that it had been
      impeded by the king's illness,&mdash;"it being the custom of the
      court to put on <i>gala</i> when any of the royal family are
      blooded. When I went to court to enquire after his majesty's
      health, I was there informed that the king, on Sunday night the
      3d instant, passing through a gallery to go to the queen's
      apartment, had the misfortune to fall and bruise his right arm;
      he had been blooded eight different times; and, as his majesty is
      a fat bulky man, to prevent any humours fixing there, his
      physicians have advised that he should not use his arm, but
      abstain from business for some time. In consequence, the queen
      was declared regent during Don Joseph's illness."</p>

      <p>This was the public version of the event. But appended to the
      despatch was a postscript, in <i>cipher</i>, stating the reality
      of the transaction. Pombal's sagacity, and his self control,
      perhaps a still rarer quality among the possessors of power, were
      exhibited in the strongest light on this occasion. For three
      months not a single step appeared to be taken to punish, or even
      to detect the assassins. The subject was allowed to die away;
      when, on the 9th of December, all Portugal was startled by a
      royal decree, declaring the crime, and offering rewards for the
      seizure of the assassins. Some days afterwards Lisbon heard, with
      astonishment, an order for the arrest of the Duke of Aveira, one
      of the first nobles, and master of the royal household; the
      arrest of the whole family of the Marquis of Tavora, himself, his
      two sons, his four brothers, and his two sons-in-law. Other
      nobles were also seized; and the Jesuits were forbidden to be
      seen out of their houses.</p>

      <p>The three months of Pombal's apparent inaction had been
      incessantly employed in researches into the plot. Extreme caution
      was evidently necessary, where the criminals were among the
      highest officials and nobles, seconded by the restless and
      formidable machinations of the Jesuits. When his proofs were
      complete, he crushed the conspirators at a single grasp. His
      singular inactivity had disarmed them; and nothing but the most
      consummate composure could have prevented their flying from
      justice. On the 12th of January 1759, they were found guilty; and
      on the 13th they were put to death, to the number of nine, with
      the Marchioness of Tavora, in the square of Belem. The scaffold
      and the bodies were burned, and the ashes thrown into the
      sea.</p>

      <p>Those were melancholy acts; the works of melancholy times. But
      as no human crime can be so fatal to the security of a state as
      regicide, no imputation can fall on the memory of a great
      minister, compelled to exercise justice in its severity, for the
      protection of all orders of the kingdom. In our more enlightened
      period, we must rejoice that those dreadful displays of judicial
      power have passed away; and that laws are capable of being
      administered without the tortures, or the waste of life, which
      agonize the feelings of society. Yet, while blood for blood
      continued to be the code; while the sole prevention of crime was
      sought for in the security of judgment; and while even the zeal
      of justice against guilt was measured by the terrible intensity
      of the punishment&mdash;we must charge the horror of such
      sweeping executions to the ignorance of the age, much more than
      to the vengeance of power.</p>

      <p>This tragedy was long the subject of European memory; and all
      the extravagance of popular credulity was let loose ill
      discovering the causes of the conspiracy. It was said, in the
      despatches of the English minister, that the Marquis of Tavora,
      who had been Portuguese minister in the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg112" id="pg112">112</a></span>East, was
      irritated by the royal attentions to his son's wife. Ambition was
      the supposed ground of the Duke of Aveira's perfidy. The old
      Marchioness of Tavora, who had been once the handsomest woman at
      court, and was singularly vein and haughty, was presumed to have
      received some personal offence, by the rejection of the family
      claim to a dukedom. All is wrapped in the obscurity natural to
      transactions in which individuals of rank are involved in the
      highest order of crime. It was the natural policy of the minister
      to avoid extending the charges by explaining the origin of the
      crime. The connexions of the traitors were still many and
      powerful; and further disclosures might have produced only
      further attempts at the assassination of the minister or the
      king.</p>

      <p>It was now determined to act with vigour against the Jesuits,
      who were distinctly charged with assisting, if not originating,
      the treason. A succession of decrees were issued, depriving them
      of their privileges and possessions; and finally, on the 5th of
      October 1759, the cardinal patriarch Saldanha issued the famous
      mandate, by which the whole society was expelled from the
      Portuguese dominions. Those in the country were transported to
      Civita Vecchia; those in the colonies were also conveyed to the
      Papal territory; and thus, by the intrepidity, wisdom, and civil
      courage of one man, the realm was relieved from the presence of
      the most powerful and most dangerous body which had ever
      disturbed the peace of society.</p>

      <p>Portugal having thus the honour of taking the lead, Rome
      herself at length followed; and, on the accession of the
      celebrated Ganganelli, Clement XIV., a resolution was adopted to
      suppress the Jesuits in every part of the world. On the 21st of
      July 1773, the memorable bull "Dominus ac Redemptor," was
      published, and the order was at an end. The announcement was
      received in Lisbon with natural rejoicing. <i>Te Deum</i> was
      sung, and the popular triumph was unbounded and universal.</p>

      <p>We now hasten to the close of this distinguished minister's
      career. His frame, though naturally vigorous, began to feel the
      effects of his incessant labour, and an apoplectic tendency
      threatened to shorten a life so essential to the progress of
      Portugal; for that whole life was one of <i>temperate</i> and
      <i>progressive</i> reform. His first application was to the
      finances; he found the Portuguese exchequer on the verge of
      bankruptcy. A third of the taxes was embezzled in the collection.
      In 1761, his new system was adopted, by which the finances were
      restored; and every week a balance-sheet of the whole national
      expenditure was presented to the king. His next reform was the
      royal household, where all unnecessary expenses&mdash;and they
      were numerous&mdash;were abolished. Another curious reform will
      be longer remembered in Portugal. The nation had hitherto used
      <i>only</i> the <i>knife</i> at dinner! Pombal introduced the
      <i>fork</i>. He brought this novel addition to the table with him
      from England in 1745!</p>

      <p>The nobility were remarkably ignorant. Pombal formed the
      "College of Nobles" for their express education. There they were
      taught every thing suitable to their rank. The only prohibition
      being, "that they should <i>not converse in Latin</i>," the old
      pedantic custom of the monks. The nobles were directed to
      converse in English, French, Italian, or their native tongue;
      Pombal declaring, that the custom of speaking Latin was only "to
      teach them to barbarize."</p>

      <p>Another custom, though of a more private order, attracted the
      notice of this rational and almost universal improver. It had
      been adopted as a habit by the widows of the nobility, to spend
      the first years of their widowhood in the most miserable
      seclusion; they shut up their windows, retired to some gloomy
      chamber, slept on the floor, and, suffering all kinds of
      voluntary and absurd mortifications, forbade the approach of the
      world. As the custom was attended with danger to health, and
      often with death, besides its general melancholy influence on
      society, the minister publicly "enacted," that every part of it
      should be abolished; and, moreover, that the widows should always
      remove to another house; or, where this was not practicable, that
      they "should <i>not</i> close the shutters, nor '<i>mourn</i>'
      for more than a week, nor remain at home for more than a month,
      nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg113" id=
      "pg113">113</a></span>sleep on the ground." Doubtless, tens of
      thousands thanked him, and thank him still, for this war against
      a popular, but most vexatious, absurdity.</p>

      <p>His next reform was the army. After the peace of 1763, he
      fixed it at 30,000 men, whom he equipped effectually, and brought
      into practical discipline.</p>

      <p>A succession of laws, made for the promotion of European and
      colonial trade, next opened the resources of Portugal to an
      extent unknown before. Pombal next abolished the "Index
      Expurgitorius"&mdash;an extraordinary achievement, not merely
      beyond his age, but against the whole superstitious spirit of his
      age. He was not content with abolishing the restraint; he
      attempted to <i>restore</i> the PRESS in Portugal. Hitherto
      nearly all Portuguese books had been printed in foreign counties.
      He established a "Royal Press," and gave its superintendence to
      Pagliarini, a Roman printer, who had been expatriated for
      printing works against the Jesuits. Such, in value and extent,
      were the acts which Portugal owed to this indefatigable and
      powerful mind, that when, in 1766, he suffered a paralytic
      stroke, the king and the people were alike thrown into
      consternation.</p>

      <p>At length Don Joseph, the king, and faithful friend of Pombal,
      died, after a reign of twenty-seven years of honour and
      usefulness. Pombal requested to resign, and the Donna Maria
      accepted the resignation, and conferred various marks of honour
      upon him. He now retired to his country-seat, where Wraxall saw
      him in 1772, and thus describes his appearance. "At this time he
      had attained his seventy-third year, but age seemed to have
      diminished neither the freshness nor the activity of his
      faculties. In his person he was very tall and slender, his face
      long, pale, and meagre, but full of intelligence."</p>

      <p>But Pombal had been too magnanimous for the court and nobles;
      and the loss of his power as minister produced a succession of
      intrigues against him, by the relatives of the Tavora family, and
      doubtless also by the ecclesiastical influence, which has always
      been at once so powerful and so prejudicial in Portugal. He was
      insulted by a trial, at which, however, the only sentence
      inflicted was an order to retire twenty leagues from the court.
      The Queen was, at that time, probably suffering under the first
      access of that derangement, which, in a few years after, utterly
      incapacitated her, and condemned the remainder of her life to
      melancholy and total solitude. But the last praise is not given
      to the great minister, while his personal disinterestedness is
      forgotten. One of the final acts of his life was to present to
      the throne a statement of his public income, when it appeared
      that, during the twenty-seven years of his administration, he had
      received no public emolument but his salary as secretary of
      state, and about L.100 a-year for another office. But he was
      rich; for, as his two brothers remained unmarried, their incomes
      were joined with his own. He lived, held in high respect and
      estimation by the European courts, to the great age of
      eighty-three, dying on the 5th of May without pain. A long
      inscription, yet in which the panegyric did not exceed the
      justice, was placed on his tomb. Yet a single sentence might have
      established his claim to the perpetual gratitude of his country
      and mankind&mdash;</p>

      <h3>SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

      <p>Elnathan was a man of many cares, and every kind of wisdom,
      but one&mdash;the wisdom of knowing when he had wealth enough. He
      evidently loved accumulation; and the result was, that every hour
      of his existence was one of terror. Half the brokers and chief
      traders in France were already in prison; and yet he carried on
      the perilous game of commerce. He was known to be immensely
      opulent; and he must have regarded the day which passed over his
      head, without seeing his strong boxes put under the government
      seal, and himself thrown into some <i>oubliette</i>, as a sort of
      miracle. But he was now assailed by a new alarm. War with England
      began to be rumoured among the bearded brethren of the synagogue;
      and Elnathan had ships on every sea, from Peru to Japan. Like
      Shakspeare's princely merchant&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>"His mind was tossing on the ocean,</p>

        <p>There where his argosies with portly sail,</p>

        <p>Like signiors, and rich burghers of the flood.</p>

        <p>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</p>

        <p>Did overpower the petty traffickers,</p>

        <p>As they flew by them with their woven wings."</p>
      </div>

      <p>The first shot fired would inevitably pour out the whole naval
      force of England, and his argosies would put their helms about,
      and steer for Portsmouth, Plymouth, and every port but a French
      one. If this formidable intelligence had awakened the haughtiness
      of the French government to a sense of public peril, what effect
      must it not have in the counting-house of a man whose existence
      was trade? While I was on my pillow, luxuriating in dreams of
      French fêtes, Paul and Virginia carried off to the clouds, and
      Parisian <i>belles</i> dancing cotillons in the bowers and
      pavilions of a Mahometan paradise, Elnathan spent the night at
      his desk, surrounded by his bustling generation of clerks,
      writing to correspondents at every point of the compass, and
      preparing insurances with the great London establishments; which
      I was to carry with me, though unacquainted with the transaction
      on which so many millions of francs hung trembling.</p>

      <p>His morning face showed me, that whatever had been his
      occupation before I met him at the breakfast-table, it had been a
      most uneasy one. His powerful and rather handsome physiognomy had
      shrunk to half the size; his lips were livid, and his hand shook
      to a degree which made me ask, whether the news from Robespierre
      was unfavourable. But his assurance that all still went on well
      in that delicate quarter, restored my tranquility, which was
      beginning to give way; and my only stipulation now was, that I
      should have an hour or two to spend at Vincennes before I took my
      final departure. The Jew was all astonishment; his long visage
      elongated at the very sound; he shook his locks, lifted up his
      large hands, and fixed his wide eyes on me with a look of mingled
      alarm and wonder, which would have been ludicrous if it had not
      been perfectly sincere.</p>

      <p>"In the name of common sense, do you remember in what a
      country, and in what times, we live? Oh, those Englishmen! always
      thinking that they are in England. My young friend, you are
      clearly not fit for France, and the sooner you get out of it the
      better."</p>

      <p>I still remonstrated. "Do you forget yesterday?" he exclaimed.
      "Can you forget the man before whom we both stood? A moment's
      hesitation <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg115" id=
      "pg115">115</a></span>on your part to set out, would breed
      suspicion in that most suspicious brain of all mankind. Life is
      here as uncertain as in a field of battle. Begone the instant
      your passports arrive, and never behind you.&mdash;For my part, I
      constantly feel as if my head were in the lion's jaws. Rejoice in
      your escape."</p>

      <p>But I was still unconvinced, and explained "that my only
      motive was, to relieve my friends in the fortress from the alarm
      which they had evidently felt for my fate, and to relieve myself
      from the charge of ingratitude, which would inevitably attach to
      me if I left Paris without seeing them."</p>

      <p>Never was man more perplexed with a stubborn subject. He
      represented to me the imminent hazard of straying a
      hair's-breadth to the right or left of the orders of Robespierre!
      "I was actually under surveillance, and he was responsible for
      me. To leave his roof; even for five minutes, until I left it for
      my journey, might forfeit the lives of both before evening."</p>

      <p>I still remonstrated; and pronounced the opinion, perhaps too
      flattering a one, of the dictator, that "he could not condescend
      to forbid a mere matter of civility, which still left me entirely
      at his service." The Jew at last, in despair, rushed from the
      room, leaving me to the unpleasing consciousness that I had
      distressed an honest and even a friendly man.</p>

      <p>Two hours thus elapsed, when a <i>chaise de poste</i> drew up
      at the door, with an officer of the police in front, and from it
      came Varnhorst and the doctor, both probably expecting a summons
      to the scaffold; but the Prussian bearing his lot with the
      composure of a man accustomed to face death, and the doctor
      evidently in measureless consternation, colourless and convulsed
      with fear. His rapture was equally unbounded when Elnathan,
      ushering them both into the apartment where I sat&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>Chewing the cud of sweet and bitter</p>

        <p>thought"&mdash;</p>
      </div>

      <p>explained, that finding me determined on my point, he had
      adopted the old proverb&mdash;of bringing Mahomet to the
      mountain, if he could not bring the mountain to Mahomet; had
      procured an order for their attendance in Paris, through his
      influence with the chief of the police, and now hoped to have the
      honour of their company at dinner. This was, certainly, a
      desirable exchange for the Place de Grève; and we sat down to a
      sumptuous table, where we enjoyed ourselves with the zest which
      danger escaped gives to luxurious security.</p>

      <p>All went on well. The doctor was surprised to find in the
      frowning banker, who had repulsed him so sternly from his desk,
      the hospitable entertainer; and Varhorst's honest and manly
      friendship was gratified by the approach of my release from a
      scene of perpetual danger.</p>

      <p>I had some remembrances to give to my friends in Prussia; and
      at length, sending away the doctor to display his connoisseurship
      on Elnathan's costly collection of pictures, Varnhorst was left
      to my questioning. My first question naturally was, "What had
      involved him in the ill-luck of the Austrians."</p>

      <p>"The soldier's temptation every where," was the answer;
      "having nothing to do at home, and expecting something to do
      abroad. When the Prussian army once crossed the Rhine, I should
      have had no better employment than to mount guard, escort the
      court dowagers to the balls, and finish the year and my life
      together, by dying of <i>ennui</i>. In this critical moment, when
      I was in doubt whether I should turn Tartar, or monk of La
      Trappe, Clairfait sent to offer me the command of a division. I
      closed with it at once, went to the king, obtained his leave, put
      spurs to my horse, and reached the Austrian camp before the
      courier."</p>

      <p>I could not help expressing my envy at a profession in which
      all the honours of earth lay at the feet of a successful soldier!
      He smiled, and pointed to the police-officer, who was then
      sulkily pacing in front of the house.</p>

      <p>"You see," said he, "the first specimen of my honours. Yet,
      from the moment of my arrival within the Austrian lines, I could
      have predicted our misfortune. Clairfait was, at least, as
      long-sighted as myself; and nothing could exceed his despondency
      but his indignation. His noble heart <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg116" id="pg116">116</a></span>was half
      broken by the narrowness of his resources for defending the
      country, and the boundless folly by which the war council of
      Vienna expected to make up for the weakness of their battalions
      by the absurdity of their plans. 'I write for regiments,' the
      gallant fellow used to say; 'and they send me regulations! I tell
      them that we have not troops enough for an advanced guard; and
      they send me the plan of a pitched battle! I tell then that the
      French have raised their army in front of me to a hundred
      thousand strong; and they promise me reinforcements next year.'
      After all, his chief perplexity arose from their
      orders&mdash;every despatch regularly contradicting the one that
      came before.</p>

      <p>"Something in the style," said I, "of Voltaire's caricature of
      the Austrian courier in the Turkish war, with three packs
      strapped on his shoulders, inscribed,
      'Orders'&mdash;'Counter-orders'&mdash;and 'Disorders.'</p>

      <p>"Just a case in point. Voltaire would have been exactly the
      historian for our campaign. What an incomparable tale he would
      have made of it! Every thing that was done was preposterous. We
      were actually beaten before we fought; we were ruined at Vienna
      before a shot was fired at Jemappes. The Netherlands were lost,
      not by powder and ball, but by pen and ink; and the consequence
      of our "march to Paris" is, that one half of the army is now
      scattered from Holland to the Rhine, and the other half is, like
      myself, within French walls."</p>

      <p>I enquired how Clairfait bore his change of fortune.</p>

      <p>"Like a man superior to fortune. I never saw him exhibit
      higher ability than in his dispositions for our last battle. He
      has become a magnificent tactician. But Alexander the Great
      himself could not fight without troops: and such was our exact
      condition.</p>

      <p>"Dumourier, at the head of a hundred thousand men, had turned
      short from the Prussian retreat, and flung himself upon the
      Netherlands. How many troops do you think the wisdom of the Aulic
      Council had provided to protect the provinces? Scarcely more than
      a third of the number, and those scattered over a frontier of a
      hundred miles; in a country, too, where every Man spoke French,
      where every man was half Republican already, where the people had
      actually begun a revolution, and where we had scarcely a friend,
      a fortress in repair, or ammunition enough for <i>feu de
      joie</i>. The French, of course, burst in like an inundation,
      sweeping every thing before them. I was at dinner with Clairfait
      and his staff on the day when the intelligence arrived. The map
      was laid upon the table, and we had a kind of debate on the
      course which the Frenchman would take. That evening completed my
      opinion of him as a general. He took the clearest view among all
      our conjectures, as the event proved, so far as the enemy's
      movements were concerned; though I still retain my own idea of an
      original error in the choice of our field of battle. Before the
      twilight fell, we mounted our horses, and rode to the spot where
      Clairfait had already made up his mind to meet the French. It was
      certainly a capital position for defence&mdash;a range of heights
      not too high for guns, surmounted by a central plateau; the very
      position for a battery and a brigade; but the very worst that
      could be taken against the new enemy whom we had to oppose."</p>

      <p>"Yet, what could an army of French recruits be expected to do
      against a disciplined force so strongly posted?" was my
      question.</p>

      <p>"My answer to that point," said Varnhorst, "must be a
      quotation from my old master of tactics. If the purpose of a
      general is simply to defend himself, let him keep his troops on
      heights; if his purpose is simply to make an artillery fight, let
      him keep behind his guns; but if it is his purpose to beat the
      enemy, he must leave himself able to follow them&mdash;and this
      he can do only on a plain. In the end, after beating the enemy in
      a dozen attempts to carry our batteries, but without the power of
      striking a blow in retaliation, we saw them carried all at once,
      and were totally driven from the field."</p>

      <p>"So much for bravery and discipline against bravery and
      enthusiasm," said I. "Yet the enemy's loss must have been
      tremendous. Every assault must have torn their columns to
      pieces." Even this attempt at reconciling him to his ill fortune
      failed.</p>

      <p>"Yes," was the cool reply; "but <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg117" id="pg117">117</a></span>they could afford it, which was
      more than we could do. Remember the maxim, my young friend, when
      you shall come to be a general, that the only security for
      gaining battles is, to have good troops, and a good many of
      them.&mdash;The French recruits fought like recruits, without
      knowing whether the enemy were before or behind them; but they
      fought, and when they were beaten they fought again. While we
      were fixed on our heights, they were formed into column once
      more, and marched gallantly up to the mouth of our guns. Then, we
      had but 18,000 men to the Frenchman's 60,000. Such odds are too
      great. Whether our great king would have fought at all with such
      odds against him, may be a question; but there can be none,
      whether he would have fixed himself where he could not manoeuvre.
      The Frenchman attacked us on flanks and centre, just when and
      where he pleased; there stood we, mowing down his masses from our
      fourteen redoubts, and waiting to be attacked again. To do him
      justice, he fought stoutly; and to do us justice, we fought
      sturdily. But still we were losing men; the affair looked
      unpromising from the first half hour; and I pronounced that, if
      Dumourier had but perseverance enough, he must carry the
      field."</p>

      <p>I made some passing remark on the singular hazard of bringing
      untried troops against the proverbial discipline of a German
      army, and the probability that the age of the wild armies of
      peasantry in Europe would be renewed, by the evidence of its
      success.</p>

      <p>"Right," said Varnhorst. "The thing that struck me most was,
      the new character of the whole engagement. It was Republicanism
      in the field; a bold riot, a mob battle. Nor will it be the last
      of its kind. Our whole line was once attacked by the French
      demi-brigades, coming to the charge, with a general chorus of the
      <i>Marseillaise</i> hymn. The effect was magnificent, as we heard
      it pealing over the field through all the roar of cannon and
      musketry. The attack was defeated. It was renewed, under a chorus
      in honour of their general, and 'Vive Dumourier' was chanted by
      50,000 voices, as they advanced against our batteries. This
      charge broke in upon our position, and took five of our fourteen
      redoubts. Even Clairfait now acknowledged that all was lost;
      two-thirds of our men were <i>hors de combat</i>, and orders were
      given for a retreat. My turn now came to act, and I moved forward
      with my small brigade of cavalry&mdash;but I was not more lucky
      than the rest."</p>

      <p>I pressed to hear the particulars, but his mind was still
      overwhelmed with a sense of military calamity, always the most
      reluctant topic to a brave and honest soldier; and he simply
      said&mdash;"the whole was a <i>mêlée</i>. Our rear was threatened
      in force by a column which had stormed the heights under a young
      <i>brave</i>, whom I had observed, during the day, exposing
      himself gallantly to all the risks of the field. To stop the
      progress of the enemy on this point was essential; for the safety
      of the whole army was compromised. We charged them, checked them,
      but found the brigade involved in a force of ten times our
      number; fought our way out again with heavy loss; and after all,
      a shot, which brought my charger to the ground, left me wounded
      and bruised in the hands of the French. I was taken up
      insensible, was carried to the tent of the young commander of the
      column, whom I found to be a Duc de Chartres, the son of the late
      Duke of Orleans. His kindness to his prisoner was equal to his
      gallantry in the field. Few and hurried as our interviews were,
      while his army remained in its position he gave me the idea of a
      mind of great promise, and destined for great things, unless the
      chances of war should stop his career. But, though a Republican
      soldier, to my surprise he was no Republican. His enquiries into
      the state of popular opinion in Europe, showed at once his
      sagacity, and the turn which his thoughts, young as he was, were
      already taking.&mdash;But the diadem is trampled under foot in
      France for ever; and with cannon-shot in his front every day of
      his life, and the guillotine in his rear, who can answer for the
      history of any man for twenty-four hours together?"</p>

      <p>My time in Paris had now come to a close. All my enquiries for
      the fate of Lafontaine had been fruitless; and I dreaded the
      still more anxious <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg118" id=
      "pg118">118</a></span>enquiries to which I should be subjected on
      my arrival; but I had at least the intelligence to give, that I
      had not left him in the fangs of the jailers of St Lazare. I took
      leave of my bold and open-hearted Prussian friend with a regret,
      which I had scarcely expected to feel for one with whom I had
      been thrown into contact simply by the rough chances of
      campaigning; but I had the gratification of procuring for him,
      through the mysterious interest of Elnathan, an order for his
      transmission to Berlin in the first exchange of prisoners. This
      promise seemed to compensate all the services which he had
      rendered to me. "I shall see the Rhine again," said he, "which is
      much more than I ever expected since the day of our misfortune.
      "I shall see the Rhine again!&mdash;and thanks to you for it." He
      pressed my hand with honest gratitude.</p>

      <p>The carriage which was to convey me to Calais was now at the
      door. Still, one thought as uppermost in his mind; it was, that I
      should give due credit to the bravery of the Austrian general and
      his army. "If I have spoken of the engagement at all," said he,
      "it was merely to put you in possession of the facts. You return
      to England; you will of course hear the battle which lost the
      Netherlands discussed in various versions. The opinion of England
      decides the opinion of Europe. Tell, then, your countrymen, in
      vindication of Clairfait and his troops, that after holding his
      ground for nine hours against three times his force, he retreated
      with the steadiness of a movement on parade, without leaving
      behind him a single gun, colour, or prisoner. Tell them, too,
      that he was defeated only through the marvellous negligence of a
      government which left him to fight battles without brigades,
      defend fortresses without guns, and protect insurgent provinces
      with a fugitive army."</p>

      <p>My answer was&mdash;"You may rely upon my fighting your
      battles over the London dinner-tables, as perseveringly, if not
      as much against odds, as you fought it in the field. But the
      fortune of war is proverbial, and I hope yet to pour out a
      libation to you as Generalissimo Varnsdorf, the restorer of the
      Austrian laurels."</p>

      <p>"Well, Marston, may you be a true prophet! But read that
      letter from Guiscard; our long-headed friend not merely crops our
      German laurels, but threatens to root up the tree." He handed me
      a letter from the Prussian philosopher: it was a curious
      <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of the <i>im</i>probabilities of
      success in the general war of Europe against the Republic;
      concluding with the words, so characteristic of his solemn and
      reflective views of man and the affairs of man&mdash;</p>

      <p>"War is the original propensity of human nature, and
      civilization is the great promoter of war. The more civilized all
      nations become, the more they fight. The most civilized continent
      of the world has spent the fourth of its modern existence in war.
      Every man of common sense, of course, abhors its waste of life,
      of treasure, and of time. Still the propensity is so strong, that
      it continues the most prodigal sacrifice of them all. I think
      that we are entering on a period, when war, more than ever, will
      be the business of nations. I should not be surprised if the
      mania of turning nations into beggars, and the population into
      the dust of the field, should last for half a century; until the
      whole existing generation are in their graves, and a new
      generation shall take their places, astonished at the fondness of
      their fathers for bankruptcy and bloodshed." After some sharp
      censures of the unpurposed conduct of the German cabinets, he
      finished by saying&mdash;"If the French continue to fight as they
      have just fought, Jemappes will be the beginning of a new era. In
      the history of the world, every great change of human supremacy
      has been the result of a change in the principles of war; and the
      nation which has been the first to adopt that change, has led the
      triumph for its time. France has now found out a new element in
      war&mdash;the force of multitude, the charge of the masses; and
      she will conquer, until the kings of Europe follow her example,
      and call their nations to the field. Till then she will be
      invincible, but then her conquests will vanish; and the world,
      exhausted by carnage, will be quiet for a while. But the wolfish
      spirit of human nature will again hunger for prey; some new
      system of havoc will be discovered by some great genius,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg119" id=
      "pg119">119</a></span>who ought to be cursed to the lowest depths
      of human memory; but who will be exalted to the most rapturous
      heights of human praise. Then again, when one half of the earth
      is turned into a field of battle, and the other into a cemetery,
      mankind will cry out for peace; and again, when refreshed, will
      rush into still more ruinous war:&mdash;thus all things run in a
      circle. But France has found out the secret for this age,
      and&mdash;<i>vae victis!</i>&mdash;the pestilence will be tame to
      the triumph of her frenzy, her rapine, and her revenge."</p>

      <p>"Exactly what I should have expected from Guiscard," was my
      remark; "he is always making bold attempts to tear up the surface
      of the time, and look into what is growing below."</p>

      <p>"Well, well," replied my honest fellow soldier, "I never
      perplex my brain with those things. I dare say your philosophers
      may be right; at least once in a hundred years. But take my word
      for it, that musket and bayonet will be useful matters still; and
      that discipline and my old master Frederick, will be as good as
      Dumourier and desperation, when we shall have brigade for
      brigade."</p>

      <p>The postillions cracked their whips, the little Norman horses
      tore their way over the rough pavement; the sovereign people
      scattered off on every side, to save their lives and limbs; and
      the plan of St Denis, rich with golden corn, and tracked by lines
      of stately trees, opened far and wide before me. From the first
      ascent I gave a <i>parting</i> glance at Paris&mdash;it was
      mingled of rejoicing and regret. What hours of interest, of
      novelty, and of terror, had I not passed within the circuit of
      those walls! Yet, how the eye cheats reality!&mdash;that city of
      imprisonment and frantic liberty, of royal sorrow and of popular
      exultation, now looked a vast circle of calm and stately beauty.
      How delusive is distance in every thing! Across that plain,
      luxuriant with harvest, surrounded with those soft hills, and
      glittering in the purple of this glorious evening, it looked a
      paradise. I knew it&mdash;a pendemonium!</p>

      <p>I speeded on&mdash;every thing was animated and animating in
      my journey. It was the finest season of the year; the roads were
      good; the prospects&mdash;as I swept down valley and rushed round
      hill, with the insolent speed of a government <i>employé</i>,
      leaving all meaner vehicles, travellers, and the whole workday
      world behind&mdash;seemed to be to redeem the character of French
      landscape. But how much of its colouring was my own! Was <i>I</i>
      not <i>free?</i> was I not <i>returning to England?</i> was I not
      approaching scenes, and forms, and the realities of those
      recollections, which, even in the field of battle, and at the
      foot of the scaffold, had alternately cheered and pained,
      delighted and distressed me?&mdash;yet which, even with all their
      anxieties, were dearer than the most gilded hopes of ambition.
      Was I not about to meet the gay smile and poignant vivacity of
      Mariamne? was I not about to wander in the shades of my paternal
      castle? to see those relatives who were to shape so large a share
      of my future happiness; to meet in public life the eminent public
      men, with whose renown the courts and even the camps of Europe
      were already ringing: and last, proudest, and most profound
      feeling of all&mdash;was I not to venture near the shrine on
      which I had placed my idol; to offer her the solemn and distant
      homage of the heart; perhaps to hear of her from day to day;
      perhaps to see her noble beauty; perhaps even to <i>hear</i> that
      voice, of which the simplest accents sank to my soul.&mdash;But I
      must not attempt to describe sensations which are in their nature
      indescribable; which dispose the spirit of man to silence; and
      which, in their true intensity, suffer but one faculty to exist,
      absorbing all the rest in deep sleep and delicious reverie.</p>

      <p>I drove with the haste of a courier to London; and after
      having deposited my despatches with one of the under-secretaries
      of the Foreign office, I flew to Mordecai's den in the city.
      London appeared to me more crowded than ever; the streets longer,
      and buildings dingier; and the whole, seen after the smokeless
      and light-coloured towns of the Continent, looked an enormous
      manufactory, where men wore themselves out in perpetual blackness
      and bustle, to make their bread, and die. But my heart beat
      quickly as I reached the door of that dingiest of all its
      dwellings, where the lord of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg120" id="pg120">120</a></span>hundreds of thousands of pounds
      burrowed himself on the eyes of mankind.</p>

      <p>I knocked, but was long unanswered; at last a meagre clerk,
      evidently of the "fallen people," and who seemed dug up from the
      depths of the dungeon, gave me the intelligence that "his master
      and family had left England." The answer was like an icebolt
      through my frame. This was the moment to which I had looked
      forward with, I shall not say what emotions. I could scarcely
      define them; but they had a share of every strong, every
      faithful, and every touching remembrance of my nature. My
      disappointment was a pang. My head grey dizzy, I reeled; and
      asked leave to enter the gloomy door, and rest for a moment. But
      this the guardian of the den was too cautious to allow, and I
      should have probably fainted in the street, but for the
      appearance of an ancient Rebecca, the wife of the clerk, who,
      feeling the compassion which belongs to the sex in all instances,
      and exerting the authority which is so generally claimed by the
      better-halves of men, pushed her husband back, and led the way
      into the old cobwebbed parlour where I had so often been. A glass
      of water, the sole hospitality of the house, revived me; and
      after some enquiries alike fruitless with the past, I was about
      to take my leave, when the clerk, in his removal of some papers,
      not to be trusted within reach of a stranger, dropped a letter
      from the bundle, on which was my name. From the variety of
      addresses it had evidently travelled far, and had been returned
      from half the post-offices of the Continent. It was two months'
      old, but its news was to me most interesting. It was from
      Mordecai; and after alluding to some pecuniary transactions with
      his foreign brethren, always the first topic, he hurried on in
      his usual abrupt strain:&mdash;"Mariamne has insisted on my
      leaving England for a while. This is perplexing; as the war must
      produce a new loan, and London is, after all, the only place
      where those affairs can be transacted without trouble.&mdash;My
      child is well, and yet she looks pallid from time to time, and
      sheds tears when she thinks herself unobserved. All this may pass
      away, but it makes me uneasy; and, as she has evidently made up
      her mind to travel, I have only to give way&mdash;for, with all
      her caprices, she is my child, my only child, and my beloved
      child!</p>

      <p>"I have heard a good deal of your proceedings from my
      correspondent and kinsman in Paris. You have acquitted yourself
      well, and it shall not be unknown in the quarter where it may be
      of most service to you.&mdash;I have been stopped by Mariamne's
      singing in the next room, and her voice has almost unmanned me;
      she is melancholy of late, and her only music now is taken from
      those ancestral hymns which our nation regard as the songs of the
      Captivity. Her tones at this moment are singularly touching, and
      I have been forced to lay down my pen, for she has melted me to
      tears. Yet her colour has not altogether faded lately, and I
      think sometimes that her eyes look brighter than ever! Heaven
      help me, if I should lose her. I should then be alone in the
      world.</p>

      <p>"You may rely on my intelligence&mdash;a war is
      <i>inevitable</i>. You may also rely on my conjecture&mdash;that
      it will be the most desperate war which Europe has yet seen. One
      that will break up <i>foundations</i>, as well as break down
      superstructures; not a war of politics but of principles; not a
      war for conquest but for ruin. All the treasuries of Europe will
      be bankrupt within a twelvemonth of its commencement; unless
      England shall become their banker. This will be the harvest of
      the men of money.&mdash;It is unfortunate that your money is all
      lodged for your commission; otherwise, in the course of a few
      operations, you might make cent per cent, which I propose to do.
      <i>Apropos</i> of commissions. I had nearly omitted, in my own
      family anxieties, to mention the object for which I began my
      letter. I have <i>failed</i> in arranging the affair of your
      commission! This was not for want of zeal. But the prospect of a
      war has deranged and inflamed every thing. The young nobility
      have actually besieged the Horse-guards. All the weight of the
      aristocracy has pressed upon the minister, and minor influence
      has been driven from the field. The spirit is too gallant a one
      to be blamed;&mdash;and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg121" id=
      "pg121">121</a></span>yet&mdash;are there not a hundred other
      pursuits, in which an intelligent and active mind, like your own,
      might follow on the way to fortune? You have seen enough of
      campaigning to know, that it is not all a flourish of trumpets.
      Has the world but one gate, and that the Horse-guards? If my
      personal judgment were to be asked, I should feel no regret for a
      disappointment which may have come only to turn your knowledge
      and ability to purposes not less suitable to an ambitious spirit,
      nor less likely to produce a powerful impression on the
      world&mdash;the only thing, after all, worth living for! You may
      laugh at this language from a man of my country and my trade. But
      even <i>I</i> have my ambition; and you may yet discover it to be
      not less bold than if I carried the lamp of Gideon, or wielded
      the sword of the Maccabee.&mdash;I must stop again; my poor
      restless child is coming into the room at this moment,
      complaining of the chill, in one of the finest days of summer.
      She says that this villa has grown sunless, airless, and
      comfortless. Finding that I am writing to you, she sends her best
      wishes; and bids me ask, what is the fashionable colour for
      mantles in Paris, and also what is become of that 'wandering
      creature,' Lafontaine, if you should happen to recollect such a
      personage."</p>

      <p>"P.S.&mdash;My daughter insists on our setting out from
      Brighton to-morrow, and crossing the Channel the day after. She
      has a whim for revisiting Switzerland; and in the mean time begs
      that if, during our absence, <i>you</i> should have a whim for
      sea air and solitude, you may make of the villa any use you
      please.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

      <p>"J.V. MORDECAI."</p>

      <p>After reading this strange and broken letter, I was almost
      glad that I had not seen Mariamne. Lafontaine was in her heart
      still, in spite of absence. At this I did not wonder, for the
      heart of woman, when once struck, is almost incapable of change:
      but the suspense was killing her; and I had no doubt that her
      loss would sink even her strong-headed parent to the grave. Yet,
      what tidings had I to give? Whether her young soldier was shot in
      the attempt to escape from St Lazare, or thrown into some of
      those hideous dungeons, where so many thousands were dying in
      misery from day to day, was entirely beyond my power to tell. It
      was better that she should be roving over the bright hills, and
      breathing the fresh breezes of Switzerland, than listening to my
      hopeless conjectures at home; trying to reconcile herself to all
      the chances which passion is so painfully ingenious in creating,
      and dying, like a flower in all its beauty, on the spot where it
      had grown.</p>

      <p>But the letter contained nothing of the <i>one</i> name, for
      which my first glance had looked over every line with breathless
      anxiety. There was not a syllable of Clotilde! The father's cares
      had absorbed all other thoughts; and the letter was to me a blank
      in that knowledge for which I panted, as the hart pants for the
      fountains. Still, I was not dead to the calls of friendship; and
      that night's mail carried a long epistle to Mordecai, detailing
      my escapes, and the services of his kindred in France; and for
      Mariamne's ear, all that I could conceive cheering in my hopes of
      that "wandering creature, Lafontaine."</p>

      <p>But I was forced to think of sterner subjects. I had arrived
      in England at a time of the most extraordinary public excitement.
      Every man felt that some great trial of England and of Europe was
      at hand; but none could distinctly define either its nature or
      its cause. France, which had then begun to pour out her furious
      declamations against this country, was, of course, generally
      looked to as the quarter from which the storm was to come; but
      the higher minds evidently contemplated hazards nearer home.
      Affiliated societies, corresponding clubs, and all the
      revolutionary apparatus, from whose crush and clamour I had so
      lately emerged, met the ear and the eye on all occasions; and the
      fiery ferocity of French rebellion was nearly rivalled by the
      grave insolence of English "Rights of Man." But I am not about to
      write the history of a time of national fever. The republicanism,
      which Cicero and Plutarch instil into us all at our schools, had
      been extinguished in me by the squalid realities of France. I had
      seen the dissecting-room, and was cured of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg122" id="pg122">122</a></span>my love for
      the science. My spirit, too, required rest. I could have
      exclaimed with all the sincerity, and with all the weariness too,
      of the poet:&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>Oh, for a lodge in some vast wilderness,</p>

        <p>Some boundless contiguity of shade,</p>

        <p>Where rumour of oppression and deceit,</p>

        <p>Of unsuccessful or successful war,</p>

        <p>Might never reach me more!"</p>
      </div>

      <p>But, perhaps fortunately for my understanding, if not for my
      life, I was not suffered to take refuge in the wilderness. London
      was around me; rich and beggared, splendid and sullen, idle and
      busy London. I was floating on those waves of human being, in
      which the struggler must make for the shore, or sink. I was in
      the centre of that huge whispering gallery, where every sound of
      earth was echoed and re-echoed with new power; and where it was
      impossible to dream. My days were now spent in communication with
      the offices of government, and a large portion of my nights in
      carrying on those correspondences, which, though seldom known in
      the routine of Downing Street, form the essential part of its
      intercourse with the continental cabinets. But a period of
      suspense still remained. Parliament had been already summoned for
      the 13th of December. Up to nearly the last moment, the cabinet
      had been kept in uncertainty as to the actual intents of France.
      There had been declamation in abundance in the French legislature
      and the journals; but with this unsubstantial evidence the
      cabinet could not meet the country. Couriers were sent in all
      directions; boats were stationed along the coast to bring the
      first intelligence of actual hostilities suddenly; every
      conceivable expedient was adopted; but all in vain. The day of
      opening the Session was within twenty-four hours. After lingering
      hour by hour, in expectancy of the arrival of despatches from our
      ambassador at the Hague, I offered to cross the sea in the first
      fishing-boat which I could find, and ascertain the facts. My
      offer was accepted; and in the twilight of a winter's morning,
      and in the midst of a snow-storm, I was making my shivering way
      homeward through the wretched lanes which, dark as pitch and
      narrow as footpaths, then led to the centre of the diplomatic
      world; when, in my haste, I had nearly overset a meagre figure,
      which, half-blinded by the storm, was tottering towards the
      Foreign office. After a growl, in the most angry jargon, the man
      recognized me; he was the clerk whom I had seen at Mordecai's
      house. He had, but an hour before, received, by one of the
      private couriers of the firm, a letter, with orders to deliver it
      with all expedition. He put it into my hand: it was not from
      Mordecai, but from Elnathan, and was simply in these
      words:&mdash;"My kinsman and your friend has desired me to
      forward to you the first intelligence of hostilities. I send you
      a copy of the bulletin which will be issued at noon this day. It
      is yet unknown; but I have it from a source on which you may
      perfectly rely. Of this make what use you think advantageous.
      Your well-wisher."</p>

      <p>With what pangs the great money-trafficker must have consigned
      to my use a piece of intelligence which must have been a mine of
      wealth to any one who carried it first to the Stock Exchange, I
      could easily conjecture. But I saw in it the powerful pressure of
      Mordecai, which none of his tribe seemed even to have the means
      of resisting. My sensations were singular enough as I traced my
      way up the dark and lumbering staircase of the Foreign office;
      with the consciousness that, if I had chosen to turn my steps in
      another direction, I might before night be master of thousands,
      or of hundreds of thousands. But it is only due to the sense of
      honour which had been impressed on me, even in the riot and
      roughness of my Eton days, to say, that I did not hesitate for a
      moment Sending one of the attendants to arouse the chief clerk, I
      stood waiting his arrival with the bulletin unopened in my hands.
      The official had gone to his house in the country, and might not
      return for some hours. My perplexity increased. Every moment
      might supersede the value of my priority. At length a twinkling
      light through the chinks of one of the dilapidated doors, told me
      that there was some one within, from whom I might, at least, ask
      when and how ministers <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg123" id=
      "pg123">123</a></span>were to be approached. The door was opened,
      and, to my surprise, I found that the occupant of the chamber was
      one of the most influential members of administration. My name
      and purpose were easily given; and I was received as I believe
      few are in the habit of being received by the disposers of high
      things in high places. The fire had sunk to embers, the lamp was
      dull, and the hearer was half frozen and half asleep. Yet no
      sooner had he cast his eyes upon the mysterious paper which I
      gave into his grasp, than all his faculties were in full
      activity.</p>

      <p>"This," said he, "is the most important paper that has reached
      this country since the taking of the Bastile. THE SCHELDT IS
      OPENED! This involves an attack on Holland; the defence of our
      ally is a matter of treaty, and we must arm without delay. The
      war is begun, but where it shall end"&mdash;he paused, and fixing
      his eyes above, with a solemnity of expression which I had not
      expected in the stern and hard-lined countenance, "or who shall
      live to see its close&mdash;who shall tell?"</p>

      <p>"We have been waiting," said he, "for this intelligence from
      week to week, with the fullest expectation that it would come;
      and yet, when it has come, it strikes like a thunderclap. This is
      the third night that I have sat in this hovel, at this table,
      unable to go to rest, and looking for the despatch from hour to
      hour.&mdash;You see, sir, that our life is at least not the bed
      of roses for which the world is so apt to give us credit. It is
      like the life of my own hills&mdash;the higher the sheiling
      stands, the more it gets of the blast."</p>

      <p>I do not give the name of this remarkable man. He was a Scot,
      and possessed of all the best characteristics of his country. I
      had heard him in Parliament, where he was the most powerful
      second of the most powerful first that England had seen. But if
      all men were inferior to the prime minister in majesty and
      fulness of conception, the man to whom I now listened had no
      superior in readiness of retort, in aptness of
      illustration&mdash;that mixture of sport and satire, of easy jest
      and subtle sarcasm, which forms the happiest talent for the
      miscellaneous uses of debate. If Pitt moved forward like the
      armed man of chivalry, or rather like the main body of the
      battle&mdash;for never man was more entitled to the appellation
      of a "host in himself"&mdash;never were front, flanks, and rear
      of the host covered by a more rapid, quick-witted, and
      indefatigable auxiliary. He was a man of family, and brought with
      him into public life, not the manners of a menial of office, but
      the bearing of a gentleman. Birth and blood were in his bold and
      manly countenance; and I could have felt no difficulty in
      conceiving him, if his course had followed his nature, the
      chieftain on his hills, at the head of his gallant retainers,
      pursuing the wild sports of his romantic region; or in some
      foreign land, gathering the laurels which the Scotch soldier has
      so often and so proudly added to the honours of the empire.</p>

      <p>He was perfectly familiar with the great question of the time,
      and saw the full bearings of my intelligence with admirable
      sagacity; pointed out the inevitable results of suffering France
      to take upon herself the arbitration of Europe, and gave new and
      powerful views of the higher relation in which England was to
      stand, as the general protectress of the Continent. "This
      bulletin," said he, "announces the fact, that a French squadron
      has actually sailed up the Scheldt to attack Antwerp. Yet it was
      not ten years since France protested against the same act by
      Austria, as a violation of the rights of Holland. The new
      aggression is, therefore, not simply a solitary violence, but a
      vast fraud; not merely the breach of an individual treaty, but a
      declaration that no treaty is henceforth to be held as binding;
      it is more than an act of rapine; it is an universal dissolution
      of the principles by which society is held together. In what
      times are we about to live?"</p>

      <p>My reply was&mdash;"That it depended on the spirit of England
      herself, whether the conflict was to be followed by honour or by
      shame; that she had a glorious career before her, if she had
      magnanimity sufficient to take the part marked out for her by
      circumstances; and that, with the championship of the world in
      her hands, even defeat would be a triumph."</p>

      <p>He now turned the conversation to <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg124" id="pg124">124</a></span>myself; spoke
      with more than official civility of my services, and peculiarly
      of the immediate one; and asked in what branch of diplomacy I
      desired advancement?</p>

      <p>My answer was prompt. "In none. I desired promotion but in one
      way&mdash;the army." I then briefly stated the accidental loss of
      my original appointment, and received, before I left the chamber,
      a note for the secretary at war, recommending me, in the
      strongest terms, for a commission in the Guards.&mdash;The world
      was now before me, and the world in the most vivid, various, and
      dazzling shape; in the boldest development of grandeur, terror,
      and wild vicissitude, which it exhibited for a thousand
      years&mdash;ENGLAND WAS AT WAR!</p>

      <p>There is no sight on earth more singular, or more awful, than
      a great nation going to war. I saw the scene in its highest point
      of view, by seeing it in England. Its perfect freedom, its
      infinite, and often conflicting, variety of opinion&mdash;its
      passionate excitement, and its stupendous power, gave the summons
      to hostilities a character of interest, of grandeur, and of
      indefinite but vast purposes, unexampled in any other time, or in
      any other country. When one of the old monarchies commenced war,
      the operation, however large and formidable, was simple. A
      monarch resolved, a council sat, less to guide than to echo his
      resolution; an army marched, invaded the enemy's territory,
      fought a battle&mdash;perhaps a dubious one&mdash;rested on its
      arms; and while <i>Te Deum</i> was sung in both capitals alike
      for the "victory" of neither, the ministers of both were
      constructing an armistice, a negotiation, and a peace&mdash;each
      and all to be null and void on the first opportunity.</p>

      <p>But the war of England was a war of the nation&mdash;a war of
      wrath and indignation&mdash;a war of the dangers of civilized
      society entrusted to a single championship&mdash;a great effort
      of human nature to discharge, in the shape of blood, a disease
      which was sapping the vitals of Europe; or in a still higher, and
      therefore a more faithful view, the gathering of a tempest,
      which, after sweeping France in its fury, was to restore the
      exhausted soil and blasted vegetation of monarchy throughout the
      Continent; and in whose highest, England, serene and undismayed,
      was to</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>"Ride in the whirlwind, and direct the storm."</p>
      </div>

      <p>I must acknowledge, that I looked upon the coming conflict
      with a strange sense of mingled alarm and rejoicing. For the
      latter feeling, perhaps I ought to make some apology; but I was
      young, ardent, and ambitious. My place in life was unfixed;
      standing in that unhappy middle position, in which stands a man
      of birth too high to suffer his adoption of the humbler means of
      existence, and yet of resources too inadequate to sustain him
      without action&mdash;nay, bold and indefatigable exertion. I, at
      the moment, felt a very inferior degree of compunction at the
      crisis which offered to give me at least a chance of being seen,
      known, and understood among men. I felt like a man whose ship was
      stranded, and who saw the storm lifting the surges that were to
      lift him along with them; or like the traveller in an earthquake,
      who saw the cleft in the ground swallowing up the river which had
      hitherto presented an impassable obstacle&mdash;cities and
      mountains might sink before the concussion had done its
      irresistible will, but, at all events, it had cleared his
      way.</p>

      <p>In thoughts like these, rash and unconnected as they were, I
      spent many a restless day, and still more restless night. I often
      sprang from a pillow which, if I had lived in the days of
      witchcraft, I should have thought spelled to refuse me sleep; and
      walking for hours, endeavoured to reduce into shape the
      speculations which filled my mind with splendours and
      catastrophes worthy of oriental dreams. Why did I not then pursue
      the career in which I had begun the world? Why not devote myself
      to diplomacy, in which I had hitherto received honour? Why not
      enter into Parliament, which opened all the secrets of power? For
      this I had two reasons. The first&mdash;and, let me confess, the
      most imperious&mdash;was, that my pride had been deeply hurt by
      the loss of my commission. I felt that I had not only been
      deprived of a noble profession, accidental as was the loss; but
      that I had subjected myself to the trivial, but stinging remarks,
      which never <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg125" id=
      "pg125">125</a></span>fail to find an obnoxious cause for every
      failure. While this cloud hung over me, I was determined never to
      return to my father's house. Good-natured as the friends of my
      family might be, I was fully aware of the style in which
      misfortune is treated in the idleness of country life; and the
      Honourable Mr Marston's loss of his rank in his Majesty's guards,
      or his preference of a more pacific promotion, was too tempting a
      topic to lose any of its stimulants by the popular ignorance of
      the true transaction. My next reason was, that my mind was
      harassed and wearied by disappointment, until I should not have
      regreted to terminate the struggle in the first field of battle.
      The only woman whom I loved, and whom, in the strange frenzy of
      passion, I solemnly believed to be the only woman on earth
      deserving to be so loved, had wholly disappeared, and was, by
      this time, probably wedded. The only woman whom I regarded as a
      friend, was in another country, probably dying. If I could have
      returned to Mortimer Castle&mdash;which I had already determined
      to be impossible&mdash;I should have found only a callous,
      perhaps a contemptuous, head of the family, angry at my return to
      burden him. Even Vincent&mdash;my old and kind-hearted friend
      Vincent&mdash;had been a soldier; and though I was sure of never
      receiving a reproach from his wise and gentle lips, was I equally
      sure that I could escape the flash, or the sorrow, of his
      eye?</p>

      <p>In thoughts like these, and they were dangerous ones, I made
      many a solitary rush out into the wild winds and beating snows of
      the winter, which had set in early and been remarkably severe;
      walking bareheaded in the most lonely places of the suburbs,
      stripping my bosom to the blast, and longing for its tenfold
      chill to assuage the fever which burned within me. I had also
      found the old delay at the Horse-guards. The feelings of this
      period make me look with infinite compassion on the unhappy
      beings who take their lives into their own hands, and who
      extinguish all their earthly anxieties at a plunge. But I had
      imbibed principles of a firmer substance, and but upon one
      occasion, and one alone, felt tempted to an act of despair.</p>

      <p>Taking my lonely dinner in a tavern of the suburbs, the waiter
      handed me a newspaper, which he had rescued for my behoof from
      the hands of a group, eager, as all the world then was, for
      French intelligence. My eye rambled into the fashionable column;
      and the first paragraph, headed "Marriage in high life,"
      announced that, on the morrow, were to be solemnized the nuptials
      of Clotilde, Countess de Tourville, with the Marquis de
      Montrecour, colonel of the French Mousquetaires, &amp;c. The
      paper dropped from my hands. I rushed out of the house; and,
      scarcely knowing where I went, I hurried on, until I found myself
      out of the sight or sound of mortal. The night was pitch-dark;
      there was no lamp near; the wind roared; and it was only by the
      flash of the foam that I discovered the broad sheet of water
      before me. I had strayed into Hyde Park, and was on the bank of
      the Serpentine. With what ease might I not finish all! It was
      another step. Life was a burden&mdash;thought was a
      torment&mdash;the light of day a loathing. But the paroxysm soon
      gave way. Impressions of the duty and the trials of human nature,
      made in earlier years, revived within me with a singular
      freshness and force. Tears gushed from my eyes, fast and flowing;
      and, with a long-forgotten prayer for patience and humility, I
      turned from the place of temptation. As I reached the streets
      once more, I heard the trumpets of the Life Guards, and the band
      of a battalion returning to their quarters. The infantry were the
      Coldstream. They had been lining the streets for the king's
      procession to open the sitting of Parliament. This was the 13th
      of December&mdash;the memorable day to which every heart in
      Europe was more or less vibrating; yet which I had totally
      forgotten. What is man but an electrical machine after all? The
      sound and sight of soldiership restored me to the full vividness
      of my nature. The machine required only to be touched, to shoot
      out its latent sparks; and with a new spirit and a new
      determination kindling through every fibre, I hastened to be
      present at that debate which was to be the judgment of
      nations.</p>

      <p>My official intercourse with ministers <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg126" id="pg126">126</a></span>had given me
      some privileges, and I obtained a seat under the
      gallery&mdash;that part of the House of Commons which is
      occasionally allotted to strangers of a certain rank. The House
      was crowded, and every countenance was pictured with interest and
      solemn anxiety. Grey, Sheridan, and other distinguished names of
      party, had already taken their seats; but the great heads of
      Government and Opposition were still absent. At length a buzz
      among the crowd who filled the floor,&mdash;and the name of Fox
      repeated in every tone of congratulation, announced the
      pre-eminent orator of England. I now saw Fox for the first time;
      and I was instantly struck with the incomparable similitude of
      all that I saw of him to all that I had conceived from his
      character and his style. In the broad bold forehead, the strong
      sense&mdash;in the relaxed mouth, the self-indulgent and reckless
      enjoyment&mdash;in the quick, small eye under those magnificent
      black brows, the man of sagacity, of sarcasm, and of humour; and
      in the grand contour of a countenance and head, which might have
      been sculptured to take its place among the sages and sovereigns
      of antiquity, the living proof of those extraordinary powers,
      which could have been checked in their ascent to the highest
      elevation of public life, only by prejudices and passions not
      less extraordinary. As he advanced up the House, he recognized
      every one on both sides, and spoke or smiled to nearly all. He
      stopped once or twice in his way, and was surrounded by a circle
      with whom, as I could judge from their laughter, he exchanged
      some pleasantry of the hour. When at length he arrived at the
      seat which had been reserved for him, he threw himself upon it
      with the easy look of comfort of a man who had reached
      home&mdash;gave nod to Windham, held out a finger to Grey, warmly
      shook hands with Sheridan; and then, opening his well-known blue
      and buff costume, threw himself back into the bench, and
      laughingly gasped for air.</p>

      <p>But another movement of the crowd at the bar announced another
      arrival, and Pitt entered the House. His look and movement were
      equally characteristic with those of his great rival. He looked
      to neither the right nor the left; replied to the salutations of
      his friends by the slightest possible bow; neither spoke nor
      smiled; but, slowly advancing, took his seat in total silence.
      The Speaker, hitherto occupied with some routine business, now
      read the King's speech, and, calling on "Mr Pitt," the minister
      rose. I have for that rising but one description&mdash;the one
      which filled my memory at the moment, from the noblest poet of
      the world.</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p class="i4">"Deep on his front engraven,</p>

        <p>Deliberation sat, and public care.</p>

        <p>With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear</p>

        <p>The weight of mightiest monarchies. His look</p>

      <h2>THE WEEK OF AN EMPEROR.</h2>

      <p>The week ending the 8th of June, was the most brilliant that
      ever occupied and captivated the fashionable world of a
      metropolis of two millions of souls, the head of an empire of two
      hundred millions. The recollection runs us out of breath. Every
      hour was a new summons to a new <i>fête</i>, a new fantasy, or a
      new exhibition of the handsomest man of the forty-two millions of
      Russia proper. The toilettes of the whole <i>beau monde</i> were
      in activity from sunny morn to dewy eve; and from dewy eve to
      waxlighted midnight. A parade of the Guards, by which the world
      was tempted into rising at ten o'clock; a <i>dejeuner à la
      fourchette</i>, by which it was surprised into <i>dining</i> at
      three, (<i>more majorum;</i>) an opera, by which those whose hour
      for going out is eleven, were forced into their carriages at
      nine; a concert at Hanover Square, finished by a ball and supper
      at Buckingham palace;&mdash;all were among those brilliant
      perversions of the habits of high life which make the week one
      brilliant tumult; but which never could have been revolutionized
      but by an emperor in the flower of his age. Wherever he moved, he
      was followed by a host of the fair and fashionable. The showy
      equipages of the nobility were in perpetual motion. The parks
      were a whirlwind of horsemen and horsewomen. The streets were a
      levy <i>en masse</i> of the peerage. The opera-house was a gilded
      "black hole of Calcutta." The front of Buckingham palace was a
      scene of loyalty, dangerous to life and limb; men, careful of
      either, gave their shillings for a glimpse through a telescope;
      and shortsighted ladies fainted, that they might be carried into
      houses which gave then a full view. Mivart's, the retreat of
      princes, had the bustle of a Bond Street hotel. Ashburnham House
      was in a state of siege. And Buckingham palace, with its guards,
      cavalcades, musterings of the multitude, and thundering of brass
      bands, seemed to be the focus of a national revolution. But it
      was within the palace that the grand display existed. The gilt
      candelabra, the gold plate, the maids of honour, all fresh as
      tares in June; and the ladies in waiting, all Junos and Minervas,
      all jewelled, and none under forty-five, enraptured the mortal
      eye, to a degree unrivalled in the recollections of the oldest
      courtier, and unrecorded in the annals of queenly
      hospitality.</p>

      <p>But we must descend to the world again; we must, as the poet
      said,</p>

      <div class="poem">
        <p>"Bridle in our struggling muse with pain,</p>

        <p>That longs to launch into a nobler strain."</p>
      </div>

      <p>We bid farewell to a description of the indescribable.</p>

      <p>During this week, but one question was asked by the universal
      world of St James's&mdash;"What was the cause of the Czar's
      coming?"</p>

      <p>Every one answered in his own style. The tourists&mdash;a race
      who cannot live without rambling through the same continental
      roads, which they libel for their roughness every year; the same
      hotels, which they libel for their discomforts; and the same
      <i>table-d'hotes</i>, which they libel as the perfection of bad
      cookery, and barefaced <i>chicane</i>&mdash;pronounced that the
      love of travel was the imperial impulse. The politicians of the
      clubs&mdash;who, having nothing to do for themselves, manage the
      affairs of all nations, and can discover high treason in the
      manipulation of a toothpick, and symptoms of war in a
      waltz&mdash;were of opinion, that the Czar had come either to
      construct an European league against the marriage of little Queen
      Isabella, or to beat up for recruits for the "holy" hostilities
      of Morocco. With the fashionable world, the decision was, that he
      had come to see Ascot races, and the Duke of Devonshire's
      gardens, before the sun withered, or St Swithin washed them away.
      The John Bull world&mdash;as wise at least as any of their
      betters, who love a holiday, and think Whitsuntide the happiest
      period of the year for that reason, and Greenwich hill the finest
      spot in creation&mdash;were convinced that his Majesty's visit
      was merely that of a good-humoured and active gentleman, glad to
      escape from <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg128" id=
      "pg128">128</a></span>the troubles of royalty and the heaviness
      of home, and take a week's ramble among the oddities of England.
      "Who shall decide," says Pope, "when doctors disagree?" Perhaps
      the nearest way of reaching the truth is, to take all the reasons
      together, and try how far they may be made to agree. What can be
      more probable than that the fineness of the finest season within
      memory, the occurrence of a moment of leisure in the life of a
      monarch ruling a fifth of the habitable globe, roused the
      curiosity of an intelligent mind, excited, like that of his great
      ancestor Peter, by a wish to see the national improvements of the
      great country of engineering, shipbuilding, and tunnelling;
      perhaps with Ascot races&mdash;the most showy exhibition of the
      most beautiful horses in the world&mdash;to wind up the display,
      might tempt a man of vigorous frame and active spirit, to gallop
      across Europe, and give seven brief days to England!</p>

      <p>An additional conjecture has been proposed by the papers
      presumed to be best informed in cabinet secrets; that this rapid
      journey has had for its distinct purpose the expression of the
      Imperial scorn for the miserable folly and malignant coxcombry of
      the pamphlet on the French navy; which has excited so much
      contempt in England, and so much boasting in France, and so much
      surprise and ridicule every where else in Europe. Nothing could
      be more in consonance with a manly character, than to show how
      little it shared the conceptions of a coxcomb; and no more direct
      mode could be adopted than the visit, to prove his willingness to
      be on the best terms with her government and her people. We
      readily receive this conjecture, because it impresses a higher
      character on the whole transaction; it belongs to an advanced
      spirit of royal intercourse, and it constitutes an important
      pledge for that European peace, which is the greatest benefaction
      capable of being conferred by kings.</p>

      <p>The Emperor may be said to have come direct from St
      Petersburg, as his stops on the road were only momentary. He
      reached Berlin from his capital with courier's speed, in four
      days and six hours, on Sunday fortnight last. His arrival was so
      unexpected, that the Russian ambassador in Prussia was taken by
      surprise. He travelled through Germany incognito, and on Thursday
      night, the 30th, arrived at the Hague. Next day, at two o'clock,
      he embarked at Rotterdam for England. Here, two steamers had been
      prepared for his embarkation. The steamers anchored for the night
      at Helvoetsluys. At three in the following morning, they
      continued the passage, arriving at Woolwich at ten. The Russian
      ambassador and officers of the garrison prepared to receive him;
      but on his intimating his particular wish to land in private, the
      customary honours were dispensed with. Shortly after ten, the
      Emperor landed. He was dressed in the Russian costume, covered
      with an ample and richly-furred cloak. After a stay of a few
      minutes, he entered Baron Brunow's carriage with Count Orloff,
      and drove to the Russian embassy. The remainder of the day was
      given to rest after his fatigue.</p>

      <p>On the next morning, Sunday, Prince Albert paid a visit to the
      Emperor. They met on the grand staircase, and embraced each other
      cordially in the foreign style. The Prince proposed that the
      Emperor should remove to the apartments which were provided for
      him in the palace&mdash;an offer which was politely declined. At
      eleven, the Emperor attended divine service at the chapel of the
      Russian embassy in Welbeck Street. At half-past one, Prince
      Albert arrived to conduct him to the palace. He wore a scarlet
      uniform, with the riband and badge of the Garter. The Queen
      received the Emperor in the grand hall. A <i>dejeuner</i> was
      soon afterwards served. The remainder of the day was spent in
      visits to the Queen-Dowager and the Royal Family. One visit of
      peculiar interest was paid. The Emperor drove to Apsley House, to
      visit the Duke of Wellington. The Duke received him in the hall,
      and conducted him to the grand saloon on the first floor. The
      meeting on both sides was most cordial. The Emperor conversed
      much and cheerfully with the illustrious Duke, and complimented
      him highly on the beauty of his pictures, and the magnificence of
      his mansion. But even <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg129" id=
      "pg129">129</a></span>emperors are but men, and the Czar,
      fatigued with his round of driving, on his return to the embassy
      fell asleep, and slumbered till dinner-time, though his Royal
      Highness of Cambridge and the Monarch of Saxony called to visit
      him. At a quarter to eight o'clock, three of the royal carriages
      arrived, for the purpose of conveying the Emperor and his suite
      to Buckingham palace.</p>

      <p>On Monday, the Emperor rose at seven. After breakfast he drove
      to Mortimer's, the celebrated jeweller's, where he remained for
      an hour, and is <i>said</i> to have purchased L.5000 worth of
      jewellery. He then drove to the Zoological gardens and the
      Regent's park. In the course of the drive, he visited Sir Robert
      Peel, and the families of some of our ambassadors in Russia. At
      three o'clock, he gave a <i>dejeuner</i> to the Duke of
      Devonshire, who had also been an ambassador in Russia. Dover
      Street was crowded with the carriages of the nobility, who came
      to put down their names in the visiting-book.</p>

      <p>At five, a guard of honour of the First Life-Guards came to
      escort him to the railway, on his visit to Windsor; but on his
      observing its arrival, he expressed a wish to decline the honour,
      for the purpose of avoiding all parade. The Queen's carriages had
      arrived, and the Emperor and his suite drove off through streets
      crowded with horsemen. On arriving at the railway station, the
      Emperor examined the electrical telegraph, and, entering the
      saloon carriage, the train set off, and arrived at Slough, a
      distance of nearly twenty miles, in the astonishingly brief time
      of twenty-five minutes.</p>

      <p>At the station, the Emperor was met by Prince Albert, and
      conveyed to the castle.</p>

      <p>The banquet took place in the Waterloo chamber, a vast hall
      hung with portraits of the principal sovereigns and statesmen of
      Europe, to paint which, the late Sir Thomas Laurence had been
      sent on a special mission at the close of the war in 1815. Sir
      Thomas's conception of form and likeness was admirable, but his
      colouring was cold and thin. His "Waterloo Gallery" forms a
      melancholy contrast with the depth and richness of the adjoining
      "Vandyk Chamber;" but his likenesses are complete. The banquet
      was royally splendid. The table was covered with gold plate and
      chased ornaments of remarkable beauty&mdash;the whole lighted by
      rows of gold candelabra. The King of Saxony, the Duke of
      Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Aberdeen, and the chief
      noblemen of the household, were present at the entertainment.</p>

      <h3>TUESDAY.</h3>

      <p>This was the day of Ascot races. The road from Windsor to the
      course passes through a couple of miles of the rich quiet scenery
      which peculiarly belongs to England. The course itself is a file
      open plain, commanding an extensive view. Some rumours, doubting
      the visit of the royal party, excited a double interest in the
      first sight of the cavalcade, preceded by the royal yeomen,
      galloping up to the stand. They were received with shouts. The
      Emperor, the King of Saxony, and Prince Albert, were in the
      leading carriage. They were attired simply as private gentlemen,
      in blue frock-coats. The Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, and
      the household, followed in the royal carriages. The view of the
      Stand at this period was striking, and the royal and noble
      personages were repeatedly cheered. An announcement was conveyed
      to the people, that the Emperor had determined to give L.500
      a-year to the course. The Czarewitch had already given L.200 at
      Newmarket. The announcement was received with renewed cheering.
      All kings are fond of horses; and the monarch of the most
      numerous and active cavalry in the world, may be allowed to be a
      connoisseur in their strength, swiftness, and perseverance, by a
      superior right. The Emperor can call out 80,000 Cossacks at a
      sound of his trumpet. He exhibited an evident interest in the
      races. The horses were saddled before the race in front of the
      grand stand, and brought up to it after the race, for the purpose
      of weighing the jockeys. He had a full opportunity of inspection;
      but not content with this, when the winner of the gold vase, the
      mare Alice Hawthorn, was brought up to the stand, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg130" id="pg130">130</a></span>he descended,
      and examined this beautiful animal with the closeness and
      critical eye of a judge.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, the pageant in which emperors most delight was
      exhibited&mdash;a review of the royal guards. There are so few
      troops in England, as the Prince de Joinville has "the happiness"
      to observe, that a review on the continental scale of tens of
      thousands, is out of the question. Yet, to the eye which can
      discern the excellence of soldiership, and the completeness of
      soldierly equipment, the few in line before the Emperor on this
      day, were enough to gratify the intelligent eye which this active
      monarch turns upon every thing. The infantry were&mdash;the
      second battalion of the grenadier guards, the second battalion of
      the Coldstream guards, the second battalion of the fusilier
      guards, and the forty-seventh regiment. The cavalry
      were&mdash;two troops of the royal horse guards, (blue,) the
      first regiment of the life guards, and the seventeenth lancers.
      The artillery were&mdash;detachments of the royal horse
      artillery, and the field artillery.</p>

      <p>A vast multitude from London by the trains, and from the
      adjoining country, formed a line parallel to the troops; and
      nothing could exceed the universal animation and cheering when
      the Emperor, the King of Saxony, and the numerous and glittering
      staff, entered the field, and came down the line.</p>

      <p>After the usual salutes, and marching past the centre, where
      the royal carriages had taken their stand, the evolutions began.
      They were few and simple, but of that order which is most
      effective in the field. The formation of the line from the
      sections; the general advance of the line; the halt, and a
      running fire along the whole front; the breaking up of the line
      into squares; the squares firing, then deploying into line, and
      marching to the rear. The Queen, with the royal children, left
      the ground before the firing began, The review was over at
      half-past two. The appearance of the troops was admirable; the
      manoeuvres were completely successful; and the fineness of the
      day gave all the advantages of sun and landscape to this most
      brilliant spectacle.</p>

      <p>But the most characteristic portion of the display consisted
      in the commanding-officers who attended, to give this unusual
      mark of respect to the Emperor.</p>

      <p>Wellington, the "conqueror of a hundred fights," rode at the
      head of the grenadier guards, as their colonel Lord Combermere,
      general of the cavalry in the Peninsula, rode at the head of his
      regiment, the first life guards. The Marquis of Anglesey, general
      of the cavalry at Waterloo, rode at the head of his regiment, the
      royal horse guards. Sir George Murray, quartermaster-general in
      the Peninsula, rode at the head of the artillery, as
      master-general of the ordnance. His royal highness the Duke of
      Cambridge rode at the head of his regiment, the Coldstream. His
      royal highness Prince Albert rode at the head of his regiment,
      the Scotch fusiliers. General Sir William Anson rode at the head
      of his regiment, the forty-seventh. Lieutenant-Colonel Quentin
      rode at the head of the seventeenth lancers, the colonel of the
      regiment, Prince George of Cambridge, being in the Ionian
      Islands. Thus, three field-marshals, and four generals, passed in
      review before the illustrious guests of her Majesty. The Emperor
      expressed himself highly gratified; as every eye accustomed to
      troops must have been, by the admirable precision of the
      movements, and the fine appearance of the men. A striking
      instance of the value of railways for military operations, was
      connected with this review. The forty-seventh regiment, quartered
      in Gosport, was brought to Windsor in the morning, and sent back
      in the evening of the review day; the journey, altogether, was
      about 140 miles! Such are the miracles of machinery in our days.
      This was certainly an extraordinary performance, when we
      recollect that it was the conveyance of about 700 men; and shows
      what might be done in case of any demand for the actual services
      of the troops. But even this exploit will be eclipsed within a
      few days, by the opening of the direct line from London to
      Newcastle, which will convey troops, or any thing, 300 miles in
      twelve hours. The next step will be to reach Edinburgh in a day!
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg131" id="pg131">131</a></span>
      The Emperor was observed to pay marked attention to the troops of
      the line, the forty-seventh and the lancers; observing, as it is
      said, "your household troops are noble fellows; but what I wished
      particularly to see, were the troops with which you gained your
      victories in India and China." A speech of this kind was worthy
      of the sagacity of a man who knew where the true strength of a
      national army lies, and who probably, besides, has often had his
      glance turned to the dashing services of our soldiery in Asia.
      The household troops of every nation are select men, and the most
      showy which the country can supply. Thus they are nearly of equal
      excellence. The infantry of ours, it is true, have been always
      "fighting regiments"&mdash;the first in every expedition, and
      distinguished for the gallantry of their conduct in every field.
      The cavalry, though seldomer sent on foreign service, exhibited
      pre-eminent bravery in the Peninsula, and their charges at
      Waterloo were irresistible. But it is of the marching regiments
      that the actual "army" consists, and their character forms the
      character of the national arms.</p>

      <p>In the evening the Emperor and the King of Saxony dined with
      her Majesty at Windsor.</p>

      <h3>THURSDAY.</h3>

      <p>The royal party again drove to the Ascot course, and were
      received with the usual acclamations. The Emperor and King were
      in plain clothes, without decorations of any kind; Prince Albert
      wore the Windsor uniform. The cheers were loud for
      Wellington.</p>

      <p>The gold cup, value three hundred guineas, was the principal
      prize. Eight horses ran, and the cup was won by a colt of Lord
      Albemarle's. His lordship is lucky, at least on the turf. He won
      the cup at Ascot last year.</p>

      <h3>FRIDAY.</h3>

      <p>The royal party came to London by the railway. The Emperor
      spent the chief part of the day in paying visits, in the Russian
      ambassador's private carriage, to his personal
      friends&mdash;chiefly the families of those noblemen who had been
      ambassadors to Russia.</p>

      <h3>SATURDAY.</h3>

      <p>The Emperor, the King, and Prince Albert, went to the Duke of
      Devonshire's <i>dejeuner</i> at Chiswick. The Duke's mansion and
      gardens are proverbial as evidences of his taste, magnificence,
      and princely expenditure. All the nobility in London at this
      period were present. The royal party were received with
      distinguished attention by the noble host, and his hospitality
      was exhibited in a style worthy of his guests and himself. While
      the suite of <i>salons</i> were thrown open for the general
      company, the royal party were received in a <i>salon</i> which
      had been decorated as a Turkish tent. Bands of the guards played
      in the gardens, a quadille band played in the ball-room, and the
      fineness of the weather gave the last charm to a <i>fête</i>
      prepared with equal elegance and splendour. We doubt whether
      Europe can exhibit any open air festivity that can compete with a
      <i>dejeuner</i> at Chiswick. The gardens of some of the
      continental palaces are larger, but they want the finish of the
      English garden. Their statues and decorations are sometimes fine;
      but they want the perfect and exquisite neatness which gives an
      especial charm to English horticulture. The verdure of the lawns,
      the richness and variety of the flowers, and the general taste
      displayed, in even the most minute and least ornamental features,
      render the English garden wholly superior, in fitness and in
      beauty, to the gardens of the continental sovereigns and
      nobility.</p>

      <p>In the evening, the Queen and her guests went to the Italian
      opera. The house was greatly, and even hazardously crowded. It is
      said that, in some instances, forty guineas was paid for a box.
      But whether this may be an exaggeration or not, the sum would
      have been well worth paying, to escape the tremendous pressure in
      the pit. After all, the majority of the spectators were
      disappointed in their principal object, the view of the royal
      party. They all sat far back in the box, and thus, to
      three-fourths of the house, were completely invisible. In this
      privacy, for which it is not easy to account, and which it would
      have been so much wiser to have avoided, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg132" id="pg132">132</a></span>the audience
      were long kept in doubt whether the national anthem was to be
      sung. At last, a stentorian voice from the gallery called for it.
      A general response was made by the multitude; the curtain rose,
      and God save the Queen was sung with acclamation. The ice thus
      broken, it was followed by the Russian national anthem, a firm,
      rich, and bold composition. The Emperor was said to have shed
      tears at the unexpected sound of that noble chorus, which brought
      back the recollection of his country at so vast a distance from
      home. But if these anthems had not been thus accidentally
      performed, the royal party would have lost a much finer display
      than any thing which they could have seen on the stage&mdash;the
      rising of the whole audience in the boxes&mdash;all the
      fashionable world in <i>gala</i>, in its youth, beauty, and
      ornament, seen at full sight, while the chorus was on the
      stage.</p>

      <h3>SUNDAY.</h3>

      <p>On this day at two o'clock, the Emperor, after taking leave of
      the Queen and the principal members of the Royal family, embarked
      at Woolwich in the government steamer, the Black Eagle, commanded
      for the time by the Earl of Hardwicke. The vessel dropped down
      the river under the usual salutes from the batteries at Woolwich;
      the day was serene, and the Black Eagle cut the water with a keel
      as smooth as it was rapid. The Emperor entered into the habits of
      the sailor with as much ease as he had done into those of the
      soldier. He conversed good-humouredly with the officers and men,
      admired the discipline and appearance of the marines, who had
      been sent as his escort, was peculiarly obliging to Lord
      Hardwicke and Lieutenant Peel, (a son of the premier,) and
      ordered his dinner on deck, that he might enjoy the scenery on
      the banks of the Thames. The medals of some of the marines who
      had served in Syria, attracted his attention, and he enquired
      into the nature of their services. He next expressed a wish to
      see the manual exercise performed, which of course was done; and
      his majesty, taking a musket, went through the Russian manual
      exercise. On his arrival on the Dutch coast, the King of Holland
      came out to meet him in a steamer; and on his landing, the
      British crew parted with him with three cheers. The Imperial
      munificence was large to a degree which we regret; for it would
      be much more gratifying to the national feelings to receive those
      distinguished strangers, without suffering the cravers for
      subscriptions to intrude themselves into their presence.</p>

      <p>On the Emperor's landing in Holland, he reviewed a large body
      of Dutch troops, and had intended to proceed up the Rhine, and
      enjoy the landscape of its lovely shores at his leisure. But for
      him there is no leisure; and his project was broken up by the
      anxious intelligence of the illness of one of his daughters by a
      premature confinement. He immediately changed his route, and set
      off at full speed for St Petersburg.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
